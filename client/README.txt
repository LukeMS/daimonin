Welcome to the Daimonin SDL client
----------------------------------

This client comes in different packages for different OS.
So called "binary packages" comes usually with a installer -
if you have run a installer before you read this you will
see a executable file in the same folder you find this
README.txt file. You system should also configured to run
the client without problems.

Now some tips for the packages and OS.

Playing with Laptops
--------------------
The base installation assume a num-pad keyboard. But every
key there is bind with a macro to the num-pad. Its easily to
change to every key you want.

To change:
Start the client and connect to the server. After you have
logged in press F11 for the keybind menu!

These macros are bound the the num-pad:
?M_CONSOLE       - opens the text console (enter on num-pad)
?M_NORTH         - move north ('9' on num-pad)
?M_NORTHEAST     - move northeast ('6' on num-pad)
?M_EAST          - move east ('3' on num-pad)
?M_SOUTHEAST     - move southeast ('2' on num-pad)
?M_SOUTH         - move south ('1' on num-pad)
?M_SOUTHWEST     - move southwest ('4' on num-pad)
?M_WEST          - move west ('7' on num-pad)
?M_NORTHWEST     - move northwest ('8' on num-pad)
?M_STAY          - stay or target self ('5' on num-pad)

To change this key, just move in the keybind menu over them
with the cursor keys, pres 'E' for Edit, return because
you don't want change the text/macro and then the key you
want assign this macro to. Do it for every of this keys
and then pres 'D' for done. You can do it for every key
except the internal menu keys. This will allow you to
customize the client like you want.


MS Windows (98, XP, ...)
------------------------
Your package should have arrived as binary with installer.
just start the file DAIMONIN.EXE. Your client should run
out of the box.

Source packages should ONLY be needed for developers. If
your got a simple .zip file and no installer and you see no
DAIMONIN.EXE and there is a folder called /make
in your /client folder - then you have got a source packages
instead of the binary packages. Just do back to the download
size and get the binary package!

Linux (and other *nix)
----------------------
You need usally to download the source packages ...

SOURCE PACKAGES
---------------
Downloading the source package requieres compiling (of course).
You will see in the folder /client a sup folder called /make.
Go in this folder and read the README.txt there. You will be
guided to your OS and what you need to do to compile the client.
Note, that you need for some OS other libaries you must perhaps
first install.
