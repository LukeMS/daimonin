Before you can compile the client, you need 3 SDL libraries.

These libs are called SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image.

You can download the source packages of the SDL libraries from the Daimonin site.
On the same download page as the client source is a library packages, including
all needed and tested 3rd party libs. 

OR you can go the homepage of SDL:
http://www.libsdl.org/index.php

Install and compile the SDL libs. 
After you have installed all SDL libs, you can compile the source.

Follow this steps:

1.) make distclean
	Type 'make distclean' to be sure you have a clean source.
	This will uninstall old installations too!

2.) configure
	Type './configure' to generate your makefiles. This will
	set the installation folder to 'client_VERSION'. To force
	a different folder type './configure --prefix="<path>/<folder>".

3.) make all
	Type 'make all'. The source will be compiled and linked.

4.) make install
	Type 'make install'. This will install 
	
Thats all.

You can compile the client without SDL_mixer (wave and ogg support). Follow the 
comments in the Makefile to remove the libs from linking.

Note, that even with linked SDL_mixer the client will run fine on systems without sound
card. The client will disable the sound automatically. Compiling it native without
sound on a system without sound is just a clean option.

You have ALWAYS to install the SDL and SDL_image libs on your system. 
The client can't run without it!
