Before you can compile the client, you need 3 SDL libraries.

These libs are called SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image.

You can download the source packages of the SDL libraries from the Daimonin site.
On the same download page as the client source is a library packages, including
all needed and tested 3rd party libs. 

OR you can go the homepage of SDL:
http://www.libsdl.org/index.php

Install and compile the SDL libs. 
After you have installed all SDL libs, you can compile the source.

Follow this steps:

1.) make clean
	Type 'make clean' to be sure you have a clean source.

2.) change Makefile
	Open the Makefile file and read the comments inside. Change all pathes
	if needed. On a clean install of the SDL libs it should run without
	changes.

3.) make all
	Type 'make all'. The source will be compiled and linked.

4.) make install
	Type 'make install'. This will copy 'daimonin' executable in the 
	Daimonin/client folder. 

Thats all.

You can compile the client without SDL_mixer (wave and ogg support). Follow the 
comments in the Makefile to remove the libs from linking.

Then you must open the file config.h in Daimonin/src/include and uncomment the line
#define INSTALL_SOUND! 

Note, that even with linked SDL_mixer the client will run fine on systems without sound
card. The client will disable the sound automatically. Compiling it native without
sound on a system without sound is just a clean option.

You have ALWAYS to install the SDL and SDL_image libs on your system. 
The client can't run without it!
