# types.xml - This is the definitions-file for all the different     #
# Daimonin object types and their attributes.                        #
#                                                                    #
# The server code of the Daimonin game is always changing and        #
# evolving. From time to time, object-attributes change in purpose,  #
# or new ones are created.                                           #
# Therefore, it is important that an Editor is flexible and          #
# easy to "upgrade" to handle such new features. That's why the      #
# DaimoninEditor reads the type-definitions from this xml file.      #
#                                                                    #
# If you encounter bugs, typos or missing entries in the LATEST      #
# VERSION of this file - Don't hesitate to improve it, contact me    #
# and eventually send the improved file to me: <red.blaze@gmx.net>.  #
# I will put it into the "official version" of the DaimoninEditor    #
# and all fellow Daimonin-Map-Makers can benefit from your work!     #
#                                                                    #
# IMPORTANT: Make a backup copy of this file before you start        #

<!--###################### default attributes ######################-->

<!--
  The attributes of the default_type get added to all other types by default.
  Every type can have an 'ignore' element however, which is used to specify
  default attributes *not* to inherit. Attributes explicitly defined in a type
  are not inherited.
  -->
<default_type>
  <attribute arch="name" editor="name" type="string">
    This is the name of the object, displayed to the player.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="title" editor="title" type="string">
    This is the object's title. Once an object is identified the title is
    attached to the name. Typical titles are "of mostrai", "of xray vision" etc.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="amask" editor="artifact mask" type="string">
	This is the name of a artifact mask which alters the original arch with the
    values defined for that artifact in the artifacts file. The item is altered
    AFTER all other attributes, even those following behind the artifact mask, are loaded.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="sub_type" editor="sub type" type="int">
    This important value is used to define "sub types" for objects of the same object
    type. Examples are weapons, which are all from type WEAPON but can be different sub types
    like slash type, cleave type, 1hand, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
    too. WARNING: not all objects have a sub_type and changing it without care can corrupt
    server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not a subject to change outside arch definition.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="layer" editor="layer" type="int">
    This is the map layer, the object will put in. The selected layer will effect where and
    how this object is shown on client side. Layer 0 is reserved for sys_object type objects
    and will NEVER be shown on client side.
    Layer 3 and 4 are for items on the ground. Layer 5 is for walls, layer
    6 is reserved for players and layer 7 is for spell effects and high flying/visible
    objects like arrows.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="face" editor="image" type="facename">
    The image-name defines what image is displayed for this object
    in-game.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="animation" editor="animation" type="animname">
    The animation-name defines what animation is displayed for this object
    in-game. Note that a set animation will overrule the face.
    Changing animation is easy - adding or deleting a animation is more
    difficult and should be done in the text parse window and not in this
    dialog.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="anim_speed" editor="anim speed" type="int">
  How fast to play this animation.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_animated" editor="is animated" type="bool">
  If set, the object is animated and animation is used.
  Note: Some special objects will use a animation NOT as animation but
  as frame list. Examples are buttons (which frames are changed by the
  object status of the button). IS_TURNABLE will enable direction turning
  for some object types. These flags are all "system" related. Be VERY
  careful to change them.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_turnable" editor="is turnable" type="bool">
  System flag. Object can be turned to the directions.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="speed_left" editor="start speed" type="float">
    NOTE: without speed != 0, this value is not used. Only use
    for objects with speed (active objects)!
    When a active object (with 'speed' != 0) is put on a map, this
    value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if negative,
    value is turned positive before) is added to this value -
    if it is bigger 0 the object 'will do something' and this counter is
    decreased with -1.0 .
    As default a normal object will put on the map with start speed 0.
    It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
    Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
    'lifetime' round until it does something.
    A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it should
    try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game. A bomb for
    example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it will stay then
    on map until the bomb becomes active - it explode.
    The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0 will
    give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100 ticks.
    Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a random
    value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a start speed of
    -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed between -1.0 and -0.1.
    This is useful to lets a row of same objects act in different tick ranges.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="nrof" editor="number" type="int">
    This value determines the number of objects in one stack (for example:
    100 gold coins =&gt; "number = 100"). You should set this at least to one, for
    any pickable object - otherwise it won't be mergeable into a stack.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="weight" editor="weight" type="int">
    This value defines the object's weight in grams (1000g is 1kg). Objects with
    zero weight are not pickable for players. Still, set the "non-pickable"-flag
    for explicitly non-pickable objects (hey, this is open source.. you
    never know ;) ).
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="value" editor="value" type="long">
    Adds a certain value to the object: It will be worth that many times the
    default value from it's archetype (E.g. "value = 3" means three times
    worth the default value). Value for buying/selling will be
    further modified by various factors. Hence, testing values in-game is
    usually inevitable.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="material" editor="material class" type="bitmask_material">
    This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)
    the object consists. Material class does also affect how likely the
    object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="material_real" editor="material" type="list_material_real">
    The material defines the exact material of which the object
    consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
    however only one material can be selected, not multiple.
    &lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left 'undefined'.
    A value of -1 will disable it and avoid every "material" setting or prefix
    when the object is loaded.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="glow_radius" editor="glow radius" type="int">
    If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value greater zero, the object
    appears lit up on dark maps. &lt;glow radius&gt; can be a value
    between 0 and 9, the higher, the more light does the object emit.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="can_stack" editor="stackable" type="bool">
    If set, the item can be stacked. Careful, don't use on
    rings or other applyable items, it will lead to side effects.
    Arrows are designed to be used as stack.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_pick" editor="non-pickable" type="bool">
    If set, the object cannot be picked up (Neither by players nor monsters).
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_pass" editor="blocking passage" type="bool">
    If set, the object cannot be passed by players nor monsters.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="blocksview" editor="block view" type="bool">
    If an item is set to block view, players (and monsters) cannot
    see beyond it unless they cross it or manage to stand on top.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="pass_ethereal" editor="etheral can pass" type="bool">
    If no_pass (blocking passage) is set, no one can pass. If this
    flag is set too, ethereal flagged objects and CAN_PASS_THRU flag can pass.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="pass_thru" editor="can pass (no ethereal)" type="bool">
    If no_pass (blocking passage) is set, no one can pass. If this
    flag is set too, objects with the CAN_PASS_THRU flag can pass.
    Ethereal can't pass this as long pass_ethereal is not set!
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_magic" editor="no spells" type="bool">
    If enabled, it is impossible for players to use (wizard-)
    spells on that spot.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_cleric" editor="no prayers" type="bool">
    If enabled, it is impossible for players to use (cleric-)
    prayers on that spot.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="player_only" editor="player only" type="bool">
    If set, only players can enter the tile the object with this flag is in too.
  </attribute>
</default_type>

<!-- This ignorelist is for all system objects which are non pickable
     and invisible. They don't interact with players at all. -->

    Abilities are to be put in a monster's inventory. They grant monsters the
    knowledge to cast spells. Spells from abilities are usually magical in
    nature, thus adding magic to the spell-damage they produce. If not marked
    as magical, the ability as natural effect can't be disenchanted or
    blocked by dispel magic.
    <br><br>
    A particularly nice feature of abilities is that they can hold two
    spells: One for short range- and one for long range use.
    <br><br>
    You should know that spellcasting monsters receive abilities via
    &lt;treasurelist&gt;.  ]]>

  <use><![CDATA[
    If you want to create "customized" spellcasting monsters, you
    should use abilities (rather than spellbooks/wands or something).
    The long/short-range spell feature can make boss-monsters more
    interesting and challenging.
    <br><br>
    You should keep in mind that magic abilities allow players
    to get better resistance. You can turn off the magic part to
    make the spells more dangerous. However, this really shouldn't
    be necessary unless you work on very high level maps.

    Altar_triggers work pretty much like normal altars
    (drop sacrifice -&gt; connection activated), except for the fact that
    they reset after usage. Hence, altar_triggers can be used infinitely. ]]>
  </description>
  <use><![CDATA[
    Altar_triggers are very useful if you want to charge a price for...
    <UL>
    <LI> ...an item. -&gt; Connect the altar_trigger (set "last_sp 1") to a creator.
    <LI> ...opening a gate. -&gt; Connect the altar_trigger (set "last_sp 0") to the gate.
    <LI> ...information. -&gt; Connect the altar_trigger (set "last_sp 1") to a magic_mouth.
    </UL>
    The big advantage over normal altars is the infinite usability
    of altar_triggers! If there are ten players on one server, they're
    quite grateful if things work more than once. =) ]]>

  <attribute arch="no_pick" value="1" type="fixed" />
  <attribute arch="slaying" editor="match item name" type="string">
    This string specifies the item that must be put on the altar to
    activate it. It can either be the name of an archetype, or directly
    the name of an object. Yet, titles are not recognized by altars.
    Remember to put a note somewhere, telling the player what he is
    expected to drop on the altar. (Often this is put in the altar's
    name: E.g. "drop 100 platinums")
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="food" editor="drop amount" type="int">
    The drop amount specifies the amount of items (specified
    in &lt;match item name&gt;) that must be dropped to activate the altar.

    If &lt;match item name&gt; is set to "money", then the value of the
    sacrificed money must be equal to &lt;drop amount&gt; (ie, if food=200, then
    200 silver, 20 gold, or 4 platinum will all work.)

    Note that the maximum possible for &lt;drop amount&gt; is 32767.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="exp" editor="reset time" type="int">
    Being activated, the altar will reset after &lt;reset time&gt; ticks.
    After reset, the altar is ready to be activated once again.
    The default &lt;reset time&gt; is 30.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="connected" editor="connection" type="int">
    If a connection value is set, the altar will trigger all objects
    with the same value, when activated. This will only work once.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="last_eat" editor="connection flag1" type="bool">
    Depending on the target object, setting this flag or not
    can have different effects. See the object you are connecting
    to this.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="last_sp" editor="ignore reset" type="bool">
    If this attribute is enabled, the altar_trigger won't push the
    connected value by altar reset. Only ONCE by dropping the sacrifice.
    This is typically used when the altar is connected to a creator,
    e.g. for selling tickets.

    If this attribute is disabled (default), the altar_trigger
    will push the connected value TWICE per sacrifice: First by
    dropping sacrifice, second by reset. This mode is typically
    used for altars being connected to gates, resulting in the
    gate being opened and closed again.

    This value defines the amount of armor-class bonus for wearing

    values are better. It should usually be set only for armor-like equipment.
  </attribute>

    If &lt;required level&gt; is set to a value greater zero, players cannot

    specified by &lt;level required in&gt;.

    For example: &lt;required level&gt; = 15, &lt;level required in&gt; = physical
    means the player cannot wear the item unless he is equal or greater
    level 15 in the physical skill category.

  <attribute arch="item_skill" editor="level required in" type="list_item_skill">
    This attribute specifies in which skill category the player
    must meet the &lt;required level&gt; in order to wear the item.
    It is meaningless when &lt;required level&gt; is zero/unset.

    For example: &lt;required level&gt; = 15, &lt;level required in&gt; = physical
    means the player cannot wear the item unless he is equal or greater
    level 15 in the physical skill category.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="lifesave" editor="save life" type="bool">
    An item with this flag enabled will save the players life
    for one time: When the player is wearing this item and his
    healthpoints reach zero, the item disappears, replenishing
    half of the player's health.

    An item with &lt;save life&gt; should not have

  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="xrays" editor="gives xray vision" type="bool">
    Xray vision allows the player to see through obstacles
    in a two-square-wide radius. This is extremely helpful and

    A player with the ability to &lt;infravision (see in darkness)&gt;
    can see better (but not perfect) in darkness. Living objects will

    For mobs, this flag is a "should-have" for high-level monsters.
    When a monster is unable to see in darkness, in the night they will

    it safely.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="stealth" editor="stealth" type="bool">
    Stealth allows the player to move silently.

    This is a very powerful ability and it

  <attribute arch="material" editor="material class" type="bitmask_material">
    This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)

    object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="material_real" editor="material" type="list_material_real">
    The material defines the exact material of which the object
    consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
    however only one material can be selected, not multiple.
    &lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left 'undefined'.
    A value of -1 will disable it and avoid every "material" setting or prefix
    when the object is loaded.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="item_quality" editor="max. quality %" type="int">
    Every item has a natural material quality, ranging from 0 top 100.
    This is a % factor, which affects the base stats of the item.
    However, &lt;max. quality&gt; does not represent the actual state of the
    item but the best &lt;actual quality&gt; value this item can ever have.

    Basic quality is 80%. If the item is made of cheap material, the
    value may be lower. If made of very fine material it may be 100%.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="item_condition" editor="condition %" type="int">
    This is the REAL quality status of item - showing how much it is
    used up. Every time the item is overused or damaged, the
    &lt;actual quality&gt; is lowered. The value can range from 0 (destroyed) to
    the maximum of &lt;max. quality&gt; (It can never get higher than that).
    The quality value represents a % value affecting the item's stats:
    Lower quality than 100% means effects like protection/damage etc.
    are reduced.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="proof_phy" editor="condition proof: physical" type="bool">

    either if that object is present or missing (-&gt; "last_sp") when a
    player walks over the inv. checker. A valid option is to remove the
    matching object (usually not recommended, see "last_heal").
    <br><br>
    Alternatively, you can set your inv. checker to block all players
    that do/don't carry the matching object (-&gt; "no_pass").
    <br><br>
    As you can see, inv. checkers are quite powerful, holding a
    great variety of possibilities. ]]>

    Putting a check_inventory space in front of a gate (one below) and
    one on the opposite side works reasonably well as a control mechanism.
    Unlike the key/door-combo, this one works infinite since it is
    independent from map reset. Use it to put a "structure" into your
    maps: Player must solve area A to gain access to area B. This concept
    can be found in nearly every RPG - simple but effective. ]]>

    Spellcasting walls pose an interesting alternative to monsters.
    Usually they are set to be undestroyable ("alive 0"). Thus, while
    monsters in a map can be cleared out, the magic walls remain. Low
    level characters for example will not be able to pass through their
    spell-area, hence they cannot loot a map that a high level character
    might have cleared out.
    <br><br>
    Another point of magic walls is that if the player dies, he has to face
    them all again. Magic walls can add a kind of "permanent thrill" to
    your maps.

    Monsters play a central role in most maps. Choosing the right
    combination of monsters for your map is vital:
    <UL>
    <LI> Place only monsters of slightly varying (increasing) strength.
         It's no fun to play for two hours just to find out the last
         monster is unbeatable. Similar, it's not exciting to fight orcs
         after passing a room of dragons.<br>
         This rule applies only for linear maps (one room after the other),
         with treasure at the end. You can sprinkle the treasure around,
         or make non-linear maps - That is often more entertaining.
    <LI> Places with high level monsters must not be easy to reach.
         Balrogs, Dragonmen and the likes should be at the end of a quest,
         not at the beginning.
    <LI> Don't stick monsters together that tend to kill each other.
         Fire- and cold dragons in one room for example is a bad idea.
         By weakening and killing each other they are easy prey for players,
         not worth the experience they hold.
    <LI> Create your own monsters, especially for "boss"-type monsters.
         Having stage-bosses guarding treasure is a lot of fun when done right.
         Avoid to create monsters with completely non-intuitive abilities:
         Don't give ice-spells to fire dragons or vice versa. Don't add
         draining attack to trolls, etc. Additionally, you should inform the
         player before he bumps right into some very special/unusual monster.
    <LI> Last but not least: Always keep an eye on the experience your monsters
         hold. Design your maps in a way that high experience
         is always well-defended. Don't make large rooms full with only one kind
         of monster. Keep in mind the different abilities/techniques players
         can use.
    </UL>
    I know it's impossible to make the perfectly balanced map. There's always
    some part which is found too easy or too hard for a certain kind of player.
    Just give it your best shot. And listen to feedback from players if you
    receive some. :-) ]]>

    Like players, monsters need &lt;spellpoints&gt; to do magic. Monsters use

    When creating a spellcasting monster, remember that &lt;max spellpoints&gt;
    and &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; are more important.
    If &lt;spelloints&gt; are set to '-1', the monster will start out with

  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="maxsp" editor="max spellpoints" type="int">
    &lt;max spellpoints&gt; is the maximum number of spellpoints a monster

    "regenerate mana" at it's disposal.

    Important: This is a relative value, dependant on monster level.
    The in-game value is calculated as follows:

    Monsters regenerate this many spellpoints each move. Each time the
    monster has a move, it gets &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; spellpoints back.
    Hence, &lt;movement speed&gt; has great effect on the monster's
    spellpoint regeneration as well.

    To make a real tough spellcasting monster, the rate of spellpoint
    regeneration is most important. If your monster is still not casting
    fast enough, give it the spell-ability of "regenerate mana".

    Monsters play a central role in most maps. Choosing the right
    combination of monsters for your map is vital:
    <UL>
    <LI> Place only monsters of slightly varying (increasing) strength.
         It's no fun to play for two hours just to find out the last
         monster is unbeatable. Similar, it's not exciting to fight orcs
         after passing a room of dragons.<br>
         This rule applies only for linear maps (one room after the other),
         with treasure at the end. You can sprinkle the treasure around,
         or make non-linear maps - That is often more entertaining.
    <LI> Places with high level monsters must not be easy to reach.
         Balrogs, Dragonmen and the likes should be at the end of a quest,
         not at the beginning.
    <LI> Don't stick monsters together that tend to kill each other.
         Fire- and cold dragons in one room for example is a bad idea.
         By weakening and killing each other they are easy prey for players,
         not worth the experience they hold.
    <LI> Create your own monsters, especially for "boss"-type monsters.
         Having stage-bosses guarding treasure is a lot of fun when done right.
         Avoid to create monsters with completely non-intuitive abilities:
         Don't give ice-spells to fire dragons or vice versa. Don't add
         draining attack to trolls, etc. Additionally, you should inform the
         player before he bumps right into some very special/unusual monster.
    <LI> Last but not least: Always keep an eye on the experience your monsters
         hold. Design your maps in a way that high experience
         is always well-defended. Don't make large rooms full with only one kind
         of monster. Keep in mind the different abilities/techniques players
         can use.
    </UL>
    I know it's impossible to make the perfectly balanced map. There's always
    some part which is found too easy or too hard for a certain kind of player.
    Just give it your best shot. And listen to feedback from players if you
    receive some. :-) ]]>

  <attribute arch="alive" value="1" type="fixed" />
  <attribute arch="randomitems" editor="treasurelist" type="string">
    When the monster is killed, items from the treasurelist will

    When a player kills this monster, he will get exactly this

    If you create special monsters of tweaked strength/abilities,
    always make sure that the &lt;experience&gt; is set to a
    reasonable value. Compare with existing arches to get a feeling

  <attribute arch="sp" editor="spellpoints" type="int">
    Like players, monsters need &lt;spellpoints&gt; to do magic. Monsters use
    them for both wizard- and prayer-spells. However, this value defines
    only the amount of *initial* spellpoints the monster starts with.
    When creating a spellcasting monster, remember that &lt;max spellpoints&gt;
    and &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; are more important.
    If &lt;spelloints&gt; are set to '-1', the monster will start out with
    maxed spellpoints.
    &lt;spellpoints&gt;.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="maxsp" editor="max spellpoints" type="int">
    &lt;max spellpoints&gt; is the maximum number of spellpoints a monster

    the monster has a decent &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt;, or the spell
    "regenerate mana" at it's disposal.

    Important: This is a relative value, dependant on monster level.
    The in-game value is calculated as follows:
    "real max spellpoints" = &lt;max spellpoints&gt; * (&lt;level&gt; + 1)

  <attribute arch="pow" editor="spellpoint regen." type="int">
    Monsters regenerate this many spellpoints each move. Each time the
    monster has a move, it gets &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; spellpoints back.
    Hence, &lt;movement speed&gt; has great effect on the monster's
    spellpoint regeneration as well.

    To make a real tough spellcasting monster, the rate of spellpoint
    regeneration is most important. If your monster is still not casting
    fast enough, give it the spell-ability of "regenerate mana".
    That, paired with high &lt;max spellpoints&gt;, is the ultimate thing.

    As the name implies, mood floors can change the "mood" of

  </description>
  <use><![CDATA[
    Mood floors are absolutely cool for NPC interaction. To make an
    unaggressive monster/NPC attack, put a creator with "other_arch
    furious_floor" under it. Connect the creator to a magic_ear, so the
    player speaks a keyword like "stupid sucker" - and the monster attacks.
    <br><br>
    To turn an NPC into a pet, put a charm_floor under it and connect
    it directly to a magic_ear. Then the player speaks a keyword like
    "help me" - and the NPC joins him as pet.
    <br><br>

    The purpose of a sign or magic_mouth is to display a certain message to
    the player. There are three ways to have the player get this message:
    The player walking onto it (-&gt; magic_mouth), the player pressing &lt;a&gt;pply

    the connection is triggered. This should be used in combination with

  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="walk_on" editor="activate by walking" type="bool">
    If set, the player gets the message when walking on top of the object.
    This is the typical configuration
    for a "magic_mouth": The player walks through a dungeon and suddenly he
    gets a message. Use this to create some roleplay atmosphere, and to inform
    the player about possible dangers or secrets.
  </attribute>

    Monsters walking over the magic_mouth do not decrease the counter.

    Often, you might want to have a message displayed only one time. For example:
    The player enters your map and you put a magic_mouth to tell him about the
    monsters and how dangerous they look and all. Later, when all the monsters
    are killed and the player leaves the map, displaying the same message a
    second time would be silly. &lt;counter&gt; 1 does a perfect job in such cases.

    When the player walks into a teleporter, he is transferred to a

    When creating maps, I guess sooner or later you'll want to have

    <br><br>
    Fortunately, there is a cool trick to make a perfectly invisible
    teleporter: You simply add teleporter functionality to the floor
    itself. That means: You take the floor arch (e.g. "flagstone"),
    set "type 41", and add slaying/hp/sp/connected... everything you need. ]]>

    The duration between two activates depends on the given value.
    Default in the teleporter arch is &lt;activation speed&gt; 0.1.

    The exit path specifies the map that the player is transferred to.

    paths whenever possible! Note that upper/lower case must always be

    If the &lt;exit path&gt; is set, ONLY players can get teleported. If the

    This most important setting defines as which type of map the destination map
    will be handled from the server.
    The default exit leads to normal multiplayer maps. Which are loaded
    from the (read only) default /maps folder and saved/swaped to /tmp.
    Instances are maps which are "unique" for a single player. Means for every
    player is an own instance is loaded. This kind of maps exists only temporary
    and if the instance is changed or newly loaded, the old instance is skipped.
    Unique maps are apartments which are permanent saved inside the players folder
    and permanent property of the player.
    Instances and unique maps will be available in later Daimonin version for groups
    and clans too.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="slaying" editor="exit path" type="string">
    The exit path defines the map that the player is transferred to.
    You can enter an absolute path, beginning with '/' (for example
    "/peterm/FireTemple/fire1"). It can also be a relative path, not beginning
    with '/' (On the map "/peterm/FireTemple/Fire2" for example I could use the
    relative path "Fire1"). Use relative paths whenever possible! Note that
    upper/lower case must always be set correctly. However, please use lower
    case only.
    It is well possible to have an exit pointing to the same map that the exit
    is on. If slaying is not set in an exit, the player will see a message like
    "the exit is closed".
    If the slaying field is blank, the destination will be the same map.

    an insertion even when the spot is not free. Use careful.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="last_grace" editor="insert at free spot only" type="bool">
    If set, the player will be put ONLY on a free spot or insertion will fail.
    If not set, the server will still look for a free spot (if fixed spot is
    not set) but will do a forced insertion to x,y when there is no free spot
    (thats default mode).
    Insert at free spot only can be used in combination with fixed or random
    spot flag.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_male" editor="instance: no reenter" type="bool">
    If set the server will always create a new instance instead of trying to
    use an old one.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_female" editor="instance: reset instance" type="bool">
    If set AND when the map is loaded as instance the players instance reseted
    so he can't reenter this map without restarting the instance.
    This setting is used for instances which can be reentered. By marking the
    final exit with it when the instance is done the player will have an real
    end of the instance.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="walk_on" editor="apply by walking" type="bool">
    If set, the player will apply the exit by just walking into it. This must
    be set for the invisible exits for example. If unset, the player has
    to step onto the exit and press 'a' to get transferred.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="fly_on" editor="apply by flying" type="bool">
    If set, the player will apply the exit by "flying into it". Flying means
    the player is levitating. E.g. wearing levitation boots.

    number of different artifacts! Besides, players will always seek the place

    Normally you can use a very low value here. A value of 0.125 means
    to check about once every second.

    Connection sensors are trigger objects that take one or more other
    connections as input. The inputs can be combined according to a logical
    rule, and generate a script event or trigger a plugin event.
    ]]>
  </description>
  <use><![CDATA[
    The output value is derived from the input connections according to one of
    the following rules:
    <br>
    NAND - the output value is set only if no input values are set.<br>
    AND - the output value is set only if all input values are set.<br>
    OR - the output value is set if any input values are set.<br>
    XOR (exclusive OR) - the output value is set if exactly one input value is set.<br>
    <br>
    For example you can use it to set up a complex combination of switches that are
    required to open a door. Simpler usages are to have a single point for scripted events
    listening on connections, or just for negating a connection value (using NAND mode).

    Beacons are markers that indicate important locations and objects
    for scripts and waypoints. A beacon can be located regardless of
    its current position as long as the map it is on is loaded in memory.

    Make sure to give the beacon a unique ID.

    To mark a map location, just put the beacon somewhere on the map. To
    mark a specific object, put the beacon in the inventory of the object.

    Remember that a beacon cannot be located when it is not in memory, e.g. if
    its map times out or is reset, or if is carried by a player that logs out.
