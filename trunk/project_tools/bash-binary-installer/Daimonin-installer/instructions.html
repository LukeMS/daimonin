<p>This installer can install the game either in normal or root user mode,
depending on how you launched the installer.

<p><dfn>Normal user mode</dfn> means the game is installed in a directory to which the
user who installed it has access. This is often somewhere under the home
directory but may be for example on some sort of removable media, such as a USB
stick. The game can only be played by the installing user (and others with read
access to the installation directory).

<p><dfn>Root user mode</dfn> means the game is installed in a fixed, central location. All
users of the system can play the game. Only root can install in this mode.
