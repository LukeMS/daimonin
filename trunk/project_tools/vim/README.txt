These files provide filetype detection and syntax highlighting for anim(ation),
arc(hetype), and art(ifact), map, and treasure list files. They're far from
perfect, but it's my first attempt. If you can improve them, please do so.

They should also be fine for Crossfire, but no promises.

To use, copy everything in this directory (project_tools/vim) to your Vim user
runtime directory (eg, ~/.vim on Linux (you may need to create this first)).
