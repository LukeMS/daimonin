The files from this Daimonin/server/lib folder are coming from the 
Daimonin/arch folder.

Depending on the package you got, there can be the files preloaded in this
/lib folder or not. If there are no files in this folder, you has to get a 
arch package.

Please read the file FOLDERS.txt in the Daimonin root folder if you want know
more about the daimonin package.
