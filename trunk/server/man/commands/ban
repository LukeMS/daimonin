~Syntax~: /ban list
~Description~:
   Lists all banned accounts, characters and IP addresses.

~Syntax~: /ban <+/-> <pl/ac/ch/ip> <str> <time>
~Description~:
   Adds or removes players, accounts, characters or IP addresses from the ban list.

~Options~:
~<+/->~ (Required) Sets 'add' or 'remove' mode.
~<pl/ac/ch/ip>~ (Required) Sets 'player', 'account', 'character' or 'IP' mode.
~<str>~ (Required) Name of player, account, character or IP address.
If <pl> mode, <str> must be an online player.  The player's account, character and IP are all banned.
<pl> mode is not valid with 'remove' mode.
If <ip> mode, IP ranges are allowed using '*'.  Only the first '*' is evaluated; the rest of the IP address is ignored.  However, all 4 parts of the IP address must always be given.  VOL cannot use '*'.  GM can only ban x.x.x.*.  SA can ban x.x.*.x.
~<time>~ (Optional) Use '1d' to ban for 1 day, '1h' for 1 hour, '1m' for 1 minute, '1s' or just '1' for 1 second.
Defaults to 60s if omitted.  Not required for 'remove' mode.

~General notes~:
    When adding a ban, any existing entries on the ban list are removed first.
    Set the ban time to -1 to make a ban permanent.
    Only GMs and SAs can permanently ban or unban!
