~Syntax~: /spawn <qty> <magic> <arch> <attribute> <value> ...
~Purpose~: Creates a mob, and places directly on the map.

~<qty>~
Optional: Sets the quantity of created objects (min 1, max 50), default 1

~<magic>~
Optional: Gives the created item a magic bonus (min -10, max +10), default 0
Note: Can only be set if <qty> is also set

~<arch>~
Required: Name of the archetype object to create

~<attribute> <value>~
Optional: Set <attribute> of object to <value>
Notes:
~+~ <value> may be enclosed by " ", to allow included spaces (e.g. title "of doom").

~+~ Multiple attribute/value pairs may be defined as required.

~+~ Attributes are applied to the created object in the order specified.

~+~ /spawn only allows the following attributes to be set:
    amask (sets artifact mask to be applied to base object)
    name
    title
    level (limit 1 to 127)
    attack_*, resist_* (limit -100 to 100) (e.g. resist_cleave 50)
    item_condition (limit 1 to 200) (this applies some random variation to a mobs ~normal~ attack / resistance values)

See also /create and /generate.
