Welcome to Daimonin's online help system.

This system provides help on topics which fall into two broad subjects.

The one is a category. Categories are broad overviews of a particular topic or element of gameplay. Category information is stored hierarchically. As you descend the hierarchy the information becomes more specific. For example, Magic/Casting/Spells.

The other is a command. Commands are the instructions a player enters to tell the game to (try to) do something.

Categories may link back to relevant commands and all commands list one or more relevant categories.
