Golem is the name for all summoned creatures that
the player has direct control over.

To control your golem, use the range system and
press CTRL + <direction> like you fire or throw 
something. Its listed under "mind control".

Your golem will then start moving in that direction,
and keep moving in that direction until you change 
its direction or you hit the <stay> direction.
