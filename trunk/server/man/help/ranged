Firing a range weapon is probably the first thing that you will use the range system for. 
First, go into your inventory and apply the range weapon (bow, crossbow, or sling). 
That will put it's picture up in the first box. 
If you don't see the picture, use tab to scroll through the different types of range attacks until you see it. 
Now, you need some ammo. 
Go to the appropriate ammunition and hit f'ire. 
Now you should see the range weapon in the first box and the ammunition in the second. 
To fire, hold the control key and use the numberpad to direct your fire. 
There is currently a delay to range firing.
