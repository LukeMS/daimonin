      ***** Shopping Help *****

You can find one shop in town, Stoneglow.
There, NPC called 'smith', is the shopkeeper.
However, you dont need to interact
with smith to be able to buy and sell
things. Smith have several services,
discover these by talking to him, 
simple 'hi' should be enough.

To sell or buy things, you need to
enter shop by magic portal. When you
are inside, sell items simply by
dropping them. You will recieve 
payment immediately.
IMPORTANT: items sold to shop are 
gone forever!

When selling stuff, you recieve only
about 20% of it's total value.
To buy items, pick them up from store
floor. All items picked up are marked
with yellow 'U', which meand unpaid.
To pay for item, leave shop through
portal. Remember to have enough money
to pay for items. If you don't have
and you can't leave shop, simply drop
the rest of unpaid items from your
inventory.
IMPORTANT: if you can't see any 
unpaid item in inventory, and shop
refuses to leave you, then it means
that you have picked up unpaid items
directly into a bag (or other
container). In such situation, open
up every bag you have and when you
will find unpaid item, drop it to 
floor.
Now, you can leave shop.
