First, be prepared for hard fights.
That means you will need equipment to
be able to fight with mosters and win.

Get yourself good armour and other items
increasing AC. Equip weapon by 'a'pplying it.
Then you have to make sure that your stance is aggresive. 
To do this, look down in the bottom left of your screen and then hit the "c" key. 
You will see that a little picture of a shield or crossed swords will change to the one that is not currently displayed. 
The shield means that you won't attack or fight back to an attacker.
The crossed swords mean that you will attack anything withing your striking distance. 
Now, you have got to target the monster. 
Hit "x" and you will see a green bar appear over the monster that is closest to you. 
Hit x again to change to a different monster. 
You can only attack the monster that you have targetted. 
You can also target friendly things with the "s" key. 
This will auto target them when you use a friendly spell such as minor healing. 
You can also see the targets health.

Note: you can't attack NPC friendly 
mobs no matter how hard you will try.
