Python Script Engine

The server use a python script engine.

To compile the server and run the python plugin, you must install python
on your computer.

You can download a binary package here:

http://www.python.org/

The default python directory for the project & makefiles is d:/python22 and the
used version python 2.2.1. (updating the version should be no problem but it
should be not lower as 2.2.1.).
If you install your python in a different folder or use a different version,
be sure you update the python directory entries in the project & makefiles too.

If you want compile the server as DEBUG version, you must download the python
source and build a python debug .lib and .dll - the python binary packages comes
without debug stuff.

Copy the pythonXX_d.lib in the same directory your pythonXX.lib is.
Copy the pythonXX_d.dll in the same directory your pyythonXX.dll is
(for windows, the .dll file comes in the windows/system directory).
