Daimonin Server Make Projects

This folder holds all official make projects to compile the Daimonin server.

Every folder holds the make files for a specific OS. Go in the folder for which
OS you want compile the server.

Read the README.txt inside this folder for more infos.

Inside the OS folders are subfolders of the compilers or IDE's you can use.
Select the right one and read the README.txt inside too.

If you can't find your OS or your compiler system, we have the source not
ported for this system.

Then you can try to port the source or setup a new project for a new compiler.

Please contact the Daimonin dev team for more infos then:
