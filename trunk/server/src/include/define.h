/* These are very special sub_types - used by different types.
 * The reason is, that different items can be missiles - amuns & throw items.
 * First, we have the amun types - arrows for bows, or bolds for xbows.
 * They need a firing weapon and get fired indirekt. Daimonin don't allow
 * to throw amun - its really senseless to try to throw a bolt and hope
 * to do any serious damage with it.
 * For throwing we have some more types.
 * First, we have the 'real' throw weapons - like darts or shurikens.
 * Second, there are weapons which can be used as hand weapons but
 * also as throw weapons. A hammer like mjoellnir or a simple spear, for example.
 * Third, there are special throw items. ATM, we have
 * Potions - like firestorm
 * Dust - like dust of blinding... etc.
 * Dusts are also from ' type POTION' but use a different base arch.
 * These special items will handled different - we allow the player to throws
 * ANY dust or potion. But only when the potion/dust is from sub_type _missile_xx
 * we include the skill id and only these items will do a range effect.
 * Every potion/dust will have a level (like a spell or rod). If this level is
 * 40% higher as our throw skill (and more as 5 level higher), then throwing
 * will fail, like we try to use a to high item device.
 * If we apply a throw potion/dust, the effect will triggered (a firestorm potion
 * will explode) but no skill id will be inserted in the firestorm objects.
 * So, the player and perhaps some mobs will take damage - but it will not give
 * any exp when this will happen. MNT-11-2002
 * have not included this 40% throw thing - perhaps later. MT-2003

/* Flag structure now changed.

 * structure.
 *
 * Hopefully, since these offsets are integer constants set at run time,
 * the compiler will reduce the macros something as simple as the
 * old system was.
 *
 * Flags now have FLAG as the prefix.  This to be clearer, and also
 * to make sure F_ names are not still being used anyplace.
 *
 * The macros below assume that the flag size for each element is 32
 * bits.  IF it is smaller, bad things will happen.  See structs.h
 * for more info.
 *
 * All functions should use the macros below.  In process of converting
 * to the new system, I find several files that did not use the previous
 * macros.
 *
 * If any FLAG's are added, be sure to add them to the flag_links structure
 * in common/loader.c, if necessary.
