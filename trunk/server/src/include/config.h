* Short list of features, and what to search for:
* ALCHEMY - enables alchemy code
* DEBUG - more verbose message logging?
* MAP_CLIENT_X, MAP_CLIENT_Y - determines max size client map will receive
* MAX_TIME - how long an internal tick is in microseconds
* PTICKS_PER_ARKHE_HOUR -how many pticks make up a game hour
* MULTIPLE_GODS - adds numerous gods to the game, with different powers
* NOT_PERMADEATH - should death be the final end or not?
* RECYCLE_TMP_MAPS - use tmp maps across multiple runs?
* RESURRECTION - lets players bring other dead players back to life.
* SECURE - Allow overriding values with run time flags?
* SPELL_* - various spell related options
* STAT_LOSS - if not 0, players lose randdom stats on death.
* USE_CHANNELS - enables channel system
* ANNOUNCE_CHANNELS - announce the channel system at login (requires USE_CHANNELS)
* USE_GRAVESTONES - enables gravestones when players die.
* USE_LIGHTING - enable light/darkness & light sources
* USE_TILESTRETCHER - enables tilestretcher for uneven ground surface
* USE_PVP - Enables players to attack each other in certain maps.

 * are living objects, the system will process all 1000 objects each tick.
