/*****************************************************************************/
/* The goal of this module is to provide support for Python scripts into     */
/* Crossfire. Guile support existed before, but it was put directly in the   */
/* code, a thing that prevented easy building of Crossfire on platforms that */
/* didn't have a Guile port. And Guile was seen as difficult to learn and was*/
/* also less popular than Python in the Crossfire Community.                 */
/* So, I finally decided to replace Guile with Python and made it a separate */
/* module since it is not a "critical part" of the code. Of course, it also  */
/* means that it will never be as fast as it could be, but it allows more    */
/* flexibility (and although it is not as fast as compiled-in code, it should*/
/* be fast enough for nearly everything on most today computers).            */

/* Please note that it is still very beta - some of the functions may not    */
/* work as expected and could even cause the server to crash.                */
