Prerequisites
-------------
Before you can compile the client, you need 3 SDL libraries:
SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image. 
You can get their source code from the SDL homepage: 
http://www.libsdl.org/index.php. 
You can normally also get them with your Linux distro package manager, 
just make sure you get the developer versions.

Compilation
-----------
After you have installed all SDL libs, you can compile the source:

1.) make distclean
	This ensures that you have a clean source.

2.) sh ./configure
	This will set up the compilation for your system. 
    
	The default installation directory is 'client_$VERSION/' in your home
    directory. For a different directory type './configure --prefix="<path>"'.

    For a system-wide installation you should use the configure 
    option '--disable-simplelayout' which splits up the installation into
    '$prefix/bin' and '$prefix/share/daimonin' with '/usr/local' as default 
    $prefix. 
    Please note that a system-wide installation requires root access.

    An installation directory made with the simple layout can be copied to
    multiple users.
    
3.) make all
	The source will be compiled and linked.

4.) make install
	This will install.
	
Thats all.

Sound problems
--------------
You can compile the client without SDL_mixer (wave and ogg support). Just use
'./configure --disable-sound'.

Note, that even when compiled with sound, the client will run fine on most 
systems without sound card. The client will disable the sound automatically. 
Compiling it explicitly without sound on a system without sound is just a clean
option.

You ALWAYS have to install the SDL and SDL_image libs on your system. 
The client can't run without them!

64-bit or Big-endian
--------------------
None of the developers have access to 64-bit or big-endian machines, so we
can't test the client on those systems. Some problems have been reported.
If you try this, please let us know how it works.

IPv6
----
The client does optionally support IPv6. To enable IPv6 support, configure with
"--enable-getaddrinfo". This is disabled by default because of buggy implementations
on some distros. See Mantis issue #0000425 for more information.
