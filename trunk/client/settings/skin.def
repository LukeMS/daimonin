# Recolours: Certain events and abilities affect how you perceive the world
# around you. Here we control how this perception is shown.
# For each perception, first the 'scale_foo' colourscale is applied to relevant
# map images. It may be 0 for none (the image is used as it
# normally is), 1 for greyscale, 2 for sepia tones, 3 for negative greyscale, 4
# for inverted colours, or 5 for intensity (which is also greyscale).
# Then the 'mask_foo' colour is masked over these images. It is recommended
# that you leave at least one colour at 0 (eg, 0xff0000 or 0x00ffff). This
# colour will then be masked out of the final image entirely.
# Where scale is intensity (5) the mask behaves differently. Here brighter
# masks cause the image's brightness to be turned up and darker masks cause it
# to be turned down.
# In all cases, a mask of 0x000000 is ignored (no masking takes place).

# 'scale_fire' and 'mask_fire' define you perception of images when you are hit
# with a fire attack.

# 'scale_cold' and 'mask_cold' define you perception of images when you are hit

# 'scale_fogofwar' and 'mask_fogofwar' define you perception of images in the

# 'scale_infravision' and 'mask_infravision' define you perception of images
# seen with infravision.
