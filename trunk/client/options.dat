# MaxSpeed
# With MaxSpeed 0 the client tries to give back unused cpu time to OS
# Sleep is the time in ms the thread will be send to sleep
# With MaxSpeed 1 the client repeat main loop with maximal speed
# Results depends on OS

# Bit per Pixel setting
# Note: 16 bpp are much faster as 32 bpp on most systems.
# Note: ** Don't use 8 bpp or your fps will go down under 10 frames **
# Note: Change your real window bpp from 32 to 16 bit to run the client faster
# AutomaticBPP 1 will set BitPerPixel to current system bpp when windowed
# For fullscreen mode will BitPerPixel override AutomaticBPP all times
# With AutomaticBPP 0 bpp will always the BitPerPixel value
# Note: On win32 systems will be the windowed mode bpp always same as the screen bpp
# Note: SDL_SetVideoMode() changes this automatically and overide the bpp pre settings

# SDL Fullscreen & Windowed Mode Settings 
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Using SWSURFACE 1 in fullscreen mode will drop the frame rate
# but it will allow you to use alpha blits (transparency). You should enable HWSURFACE
# + DOUBLEBUF only when you REALLY need the speed because Daimonin use alot 
# transparency effects.
#
# Note: You can set buffers & options for both modes
# Note: Use ForceRedraw 1 to control the speed effects of the settings.
# Note: Don't forget to change ForceRedraw to 0 after testing!
# Fullscreen 0 is windowed mode. 
# All options starting with Full_xx are used for fullscreen mode
# All options starting with Win_xx are used for windowed mode 
#
# RLEACCEL will speed blits in most modes alot.
# This can change in a few situations if the drivers use real hw to hw blits.
# UseUpdateRect force SDL_UpdateRect() instead of flip().
# Note: flip() should be faster in most cases.
# WARNING: On some systems (win32,...) DOUBLEBUF and Update_Rect() cause a black screen!
