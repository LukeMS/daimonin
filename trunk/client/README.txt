Welcome to the Daimonin SDL client
----------------------------------

This client comes in different packages for different OS.
So called "binary packages" comes usually with a installer -
if you have run a installer before you read this you will
see a executable file in the same folder you find this
README.txt file. You system should also configured to run
the client without problems.

Now some tips for the packages and OS.

Playing with Laptops
--------------------
The keys.dat file in the settings directory defines the
default keybindings. It assumes a num-pad and binds movement
to the num-pad keys.

For laptops where this is not convenient, an alternative
set of bindings is provided in keys-laptop.dat. To use,
simply rename keys.dat as keys-full.dat and keys-laptop.dat
as keys.dat.


MS Windows (98, XP, ...)
------------------------
Your package should have arrived as binary with installer.
just start the file DAIMONIN.EXE. Your client should run
out of the box.

Source packages should ONLY be needed for developers. If
your got a simple .zip file and no installer and you see no
DAIMONIN.EXE and there is a folder called /make
in your /client folder - then you have got a source packages
instead of the binary packages. Just do back to the download
size and get the binary package!

Linux (and other *nix)
----------------------
You need usally to download the source packages ...

SOURCE PACKAGES
---------------
Downloading the source package requieres compiling (of course).
You will see in the folder /client a sup folder called /make.
Go in this folder and read the README.txt there. You will be
guided to your OS and what you need to do to compile the client.
Note, that you need for some OS other libaries you must perhaps
first install.
