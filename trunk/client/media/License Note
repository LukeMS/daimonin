Daimonin Media License
----------------------

Disclaimer

The Daimonin Media License is the Artistic License, which can be found
in the Daimonin main folder.

Because the Daimonin/client/media folder can be user extended, the Daimonin
Artistic License is ONLY VALID FOR MEDIA FILES WHICH ARE PART OF THE DAIMONIN
OPEN SOURCE PROJECT.

This includes ONLY files which are part of the Daimonin CVS tree.

Is a file in this folder NOT part of the Daimonin CVS tree, it is NOT a official
Daimonin media file. In this case a 3rd party (user) has altered the content
of the media folder and/or the whole Daimonin package.

The common alteration of the media folder comes with "media extension packages" 
for the daimonin project. This kind of packages are not official project parts
and/or submited by users or a different 3rd party.

It IS allowed to change, delete or extend the media folder for personal use.

It is NOT allowed to make this altered package public as part of the Daimonin 
project - it is only allowed to make it puplic as a  "user media extension package
for Daimonin".

This kind of package must be declared as daimonin media extension. It is not allowed
to trade any original Daimonin project file inside this packages, except licence or
documentation files.

A copyright note inside that package must explain this explicit to avoid any confusion.

A file inside the media folder will NEVER be send or even altered to or from the
server - a server or 3rd party has no direct access to the media folder. The only way
to change files inside the media folder is to user install them.

Remember that you have to control the right use of copyrights when you use 3rd
party files for this folder.

You can control the official Daimonin files by browsing the Daimonin CVS file
list which can be found on the Daimonin project page.

Personal note: 
I had written this file to avoid any copyright problems with 3rd partys who think they 
can/should trade unofficial files in the media folder as part of Daimonin. It is not
to harm any 3rd party extension.
