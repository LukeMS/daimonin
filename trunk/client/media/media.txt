Beside the official Daimonin media packages,
user can change the media files or create new packages.

Please note:

User defined media packages are NOT part of the Daimonin system
and/or the license. They are NOT avaible from the official Daimonin
host.

If a user change the content of the media folder, all copyright or law
issues are part of HIS action.

All references to the files inside the media folder are neutral tags.
Nor the system or a server has any knowledge about the content of the media
folder. 

A user has to change by hand the file names and install and copy then to the 
media folder. Please be sure you don't hurt any copyright law in this action.

** It is forbidden to copy, trade or offer Daimonin client packages with user
   modified media folder. This action will be against the GNU Open Source licence
   and any other copyright issue **

Selfmade media packages must come without ANY official Daimonin file.
