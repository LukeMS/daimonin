Book GUI and game languages
---------------------------

When a player applies a book, the text is no longer shown at client side
in the text window but in a special book like GUI.

That GUI shows a book, where you can turn pages by pressing the
cursor keys (TODO: mouse click).

Shown is the text of a book object inside the msg/endmsg block.

The text is autoformated:
- lines are wraped when to long
- if the lines exceed the line count per page a new page is created

(TODO: numbers of chars per line and lines per book are still under work)

The text can be formated by using html like tags.
A books text can look like this:

msg
   <t t="Welcome to the Book GUI">
   This is line 1
   This is line 2

   This is line 4 after line 3 without text
   <p><t t="This page 2 title">
   And some more text 2nd page.
   <t t="This is a paragraph title">
   some more text
   and more
endmsg

Format tags:

<p> : The <p> tag will create a new page

<t t="<text>"> : the <t> tag will create a title. 
   t="<text>"  : The t="" cmd is the (title) text

TODO: more commands like text color or text-style


LANGUAGES
---------

A book can be marked as "written" in a language.
This is just a server sided flag.
A language is a part of the skill "literacy".
The player can learn languages.

If the player knows the language, he can read the book - that means
the server sends the book text. If the player don't knows the language
the server don't sends the text.

To make this system easy as possible, we don't distinguish between scripts
and languages.

The server and editor  knows this languages:
(from types.xml)

<list name="language">
  <entry value="0"  name="common" />
  <entry value="1"  name="dwarvish" />
  <entry value="2"  name="ancient dwarvish" />
  <entry value="4"  name="elvish" />
  <entry value="8"  name="high elvish" />
  <entry value="16"  name="drow" />
  <entry value="32"  name="gnomish" />
  <entry value="64"  name="old council" />
  <entry value="128"  name="elder pictograms" />
  <entry value="256"  name="chaotic" />
  <entry value="512" name="evil runic" />
  <entry value="1024" name="runic" />
  <entry value="2048" name="dragonish" />
  <entry value="4096" name="jotun" />
  <entry value="8192" name="high planar" />
  <entry value="16384" name="orc runes" />
</list>
