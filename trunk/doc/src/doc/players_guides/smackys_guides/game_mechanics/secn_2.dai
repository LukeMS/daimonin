            Overview
        </title>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, very few people can plug directly into their computer. Therefore it is necessary to create a character for you to play in Daimonin.
        </p>

        <p>
            Move between fields with UP/DOWN and change the value with LEFT/RIGHT.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="race">
        <title>
            Choose a race
        </title>
        <p>
            First choose a race. Daimonin currently knows only two races: human and half-elf.
        </p>
        <p>
            Race determines the base values of your stats (see below) but has no other effect on gameplay.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="gender">
        <title>
            Choose a gender
        </title>
        <p>
            Next choose a gender from the conventional male and female.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gender has no effect on gameplay.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="stats">
        <title>
            Choose your starting stats
        </title>
        <p>
            Lastly allocate additional points amongst your stats. A detailed explanation is in <a href="../character/secn_1-3.dai">"The Character, Section 1-3: Stats"</a> but briefly they are:

        <p>
            You have five additional points, all of which must be used. The base values are determined by your chosen race. Each stat can only be raised by up to two points above its base value and cannot be lowered below.
