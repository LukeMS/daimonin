    <p>There's no easy way to say this. As in the real world, everyone dies eventually.

        <p>Happily, unlike the real world, death is not permanent. Also, there is no limit on how often or frequently you can die.

        <p>When you die you will be transported back to the church (or to bed if you own an apartment).

        <p>You will also be cured of any disease you are currently suffering and relieved of any poison in your bloodstream.
        </p>
        <p>If your level is three or above you will also lose a chunk of experience from <em>every</em> skill (although you cannot lose a level in this way), and possibly one point from a random stat.

        <p>A temporary gravestone marks the spot where you met your demise.
        </p>
        <p>Also, a short message (your name and cause of death) is broadcast to all players for their amusement.
