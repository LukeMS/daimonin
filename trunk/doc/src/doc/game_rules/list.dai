            Introduction
        </title>
        <p>
            Below is a list of the rules in overview. They have been split into three categories to reflect their triple purpose. Although some attempt has been made to organise the rules within their category this should not be read as an order of importance or precedence. All rules are included for a reason and all rules should be regarded as mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each rule is further explained in it's own sticky in this board: you will find precise details of what the rule means and why we have it, and likely penalties for breaking the rule.

                1. <strong>Abuse of the game</strong> -- These rules are designed to protect the game itself from abuse and exploitation. This means the server itself and everything to which the client has direct access. That is everything which you ever see on screen, and all content (such as maps and arches and player data files). The importance of this category cannot be stressed too much. This category, and thus the rules within, protects the environment without which the other two categories could not exist.

               2. <strong>Abuse of the community</strong> -- It is recognised that the community of players is vital to Daimonin. Therefore this category of rules exists. This category, and thus the rules within, protects the <em>players</em> of Daimonin, both as individuals and together as a community.

                3. <strong>Abuse of the rules</strong> -- The final category, while of no lesser importance than the previous two, essentially exists only to link those two. This category, and thus the rules within, provides a solid basis for the existance and TODO
