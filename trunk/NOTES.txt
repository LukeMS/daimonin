Daimonin TODO

KNOWN BUGS:
24.09.2003 - there seems a little bug in the target system, sometimes a possible target
             is not selected. 
TODO:
21.09.2003 - rework move_gate() and move_timed_gate() - see notes in move_gate().
             add gate_close/gate_open sound. (sound added to client).
23.09.2003 - EDITOR TODO: Inserting a mob in the inventory of a spawn point should autochange
             his base attributes to be a SPAWN_POINT_MOB and set speed_left=speed; speed=0
23.09.2003 - TODO: merging of items need to be fixed to new attack/resist/protection. For example
             will arrows (throwing items) merge without take care - good items will get lost.
25.09.2003 - encumberace is still bound to the REAL speed of the object - and the real speed
             of the player object effects the poll of the socket - thats NOT good and a 
             design flaw. In old cf days, this was senseful - today is not.
