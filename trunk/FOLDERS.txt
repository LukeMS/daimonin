Daimonin Folder and Packages

The Daimonin project has a fixed folder structure to provide simple access to the
required files and executables under different OS.

Aside from the whole project package there are some other packages for special use
(e.g. mapmaker and music packages).

The default project structure:

Daimonin/
	arch/			<- Arch files and server files for server/lib
	bin/			<- Binaries and/or script files to run binaries
	client/			<- The SDL client
	client3d/		<- The 3D client (under development)
	dev/			<- OS specific dev tools (DEV team only)
	doc/			<- Project documentation
	editor/			<- Available via separate package (http://gridarta.sourceforge.net/)
	maps/			<- Map files (for use with editor or server)
	project_tools		<- Various tools for different aspects of the project
	server/			<- The Daimonin server


For the server/ folder you will see this
	server/
		data/		<- Generated from /install/
		install/	<- Scripts to install the server and generate folders and files
		lib/		<- Files generated from /arch with the editor
		make/		<- Make files, only included if this package contains a /src folder
		man/		<- The online manual for server commands
		plugins/	<- Plugins. Default plugin is the LUA script engine
		src/		<- Source files for the server. Binary packages have no /src folder
