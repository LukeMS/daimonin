Daimonin Folder and Packages

The Daimonin project has a fixed folder structure to provide simple access to the
needed files and executables under different OS.

Aside the whole project package there are some other packages for special use.

The default project structure:

Daimonin/
	arch/			<- The arch files and server files for server/lib
	bin/			<- binaries and/or script files to run binaries
	client/			<- The SDL client
	doc/			<- The whole project docs
	dev/			<- OS specific dev tools (DEV team only)
	editor/			<- unused (goto http://gridarta.sourceforge.net/)
	maps/			<- The map files (for use with editor or server)
	server/			<- The Daimonin server


For the server/ folder you will see this
	server/
		data/		<- is generated from /install/
		install/	<- scripts to install the server and generate folders and files
		lib/		<- files are generated and copied from /arch with the editor
		make/		<- make files, only included if this package contents a /src folder
		man/		<- the online manual of the server commands
		plugins/	<- plugins. Default plugin is the python script engine
		src/		<- the source of the server. binary packages hs no /src folder
