...and then did the Alchemist agree to
make me my potion. First he called to 
his grimm servants who hauld forth a 
great iron cauldron. Into this black 
device did he deposit his ingredients
and, opening his spell book for refer-
ence, then did he cast his spell of 
alchemy therepon the cauldron. 

Greatly did the tub shake and move!
I thought that the Alchemist had broke
his device, but he chuckled at my ig-
norance. Into the cauldron did he reach
an brought forth a filled bottle of 
golden amber fluid...

<t t="The Widow's Scandal"><p>
I, Vito the Priest stopped by at the tavern in Iluma. Normally I wouldn't step foot in such a foul establishment but I was there to spread the faith so he had to come to the heathens...

When I stepped inside it was practically deserted, but I was approached by a woman who reeked of booze with clothes that seemed to be stained in vomit. She swayed from side to side as she approached. Having glanced at the barman it soon became apparent that she had a hefty tab.

The woman went by the name of Evangel Nerina. This woman was a self proclaimed widow, even though she had the look of a professional swindler so I didn't believe her words unconditionally. She came up with some story about how her husband had been possessed by a cursed axe he found in a chest. She then required my assistance in killing the spirit of an undead Warrior King to allow her husband's soul to be put to rest

However the story stinked almost as much as Evangel Nerina. To start with in her whole story she couldn't even name her husband. When pressed it appeared she had forgotten... 

Considering it odd that there were so many widows seeking rest for their husband's souls that I decided to do some investigating. Maybe I could find something that linked all the victims. In the last year in the local church there has been 232 weddings. To my horror I discovered that in 210 of these weddings the bride was called Evangel Nerina. There was definitely something amiss going on.

To investigate I figured I had to go to the Tower of Bebeniss. While Evangel Nerina insisted I give her parts of the talisman I was rightly wary of trusting her too much. For all I knew touching the talisman could be a means to make me the next victim/husband.

I climbed the tower, using the power of the Tabernacle to undo the barriers and finally reached the Warrior King she wanted slain. I faced Sarthaug, Undead Warrior King and from his spirit I sensed the words "so she sent you..."

I said that yes, I had been sent to put his soul to rest and to my surprise he replied that he would never know rest when that witch still lived. It turned out that Sarthaug was actually Evangel Nerina's first husband. However they had a difficult marriage as she kept drinking and was violent to the children.

Finally he had enough and wanted a divorce. She then presented him a cursed axe in a chest as a farewell gift that she claimed was an old family heirloom. She then forced him to go to the tower, transformed him into an undead creature and returned to Illuma claiming her husband had been possessed by the evil spirit of an ancient Warrior King. Then brave adventurers would "fight" the undead Warrior King and "recover" the cursed axe unknowingly becoming her next victim. She would pretend to "fall" for them and force the adventurer under compulsion to marry her and then claim all his assets. The adventurer would then become cursed and killed by her next husband.

It was clear at a glance that the axe contained the tortured souls of hundreds of adventurers. While a cleric could resist the curse it was obvious that a normal adventurer had no chance. I then did the only humane thing. I returned to Illuma, killed Evangel Nerina and cleansed the axe to free the souls.

Alas it appears that Evangel Nerina was a being with a lot of malice and even my divine skills weren't enough to fully eradicate her. It is for this reason I write this tale so that should the vengeful spirit of Evangel Nerina reappear that adventures are warned to beware!

<t t="Arden - The Posh Warrior"><p>
"...And that's 250 gold." Said the young gentleman tucking a much lightened leather pouch into his wyvern legging pocket. The elderly man, who stood opposite him, smiled appreciatively as he double checked the money on his desk.
"Very well, young sir," his creaky but firm voice spoke, "your new apartment is through the portal - and a very fine one it is indeed - enter and exit as per normal. New? enchantments have been cast to transport you there. I have also taken the liberty of moving all of your items from your old apartment to the new one." The young man smiled and shook the older man's wrinkled, pink clad, hands, thanking him as he let go.

Eager to see his new residence, Arden had to control his feet to stop himself running to the portal. Instead, he stood next to it and hopped inside. The peculiar yet increasingly familiar feeling of his insides being mixed around came upon him. Several seconds later he landed with a gentle thud (much more so than his first time through the portal which had seen him flung to the floor) on a royal red carpet: ahead of him was a curtain which Arden rushed through, missing a crate by the wall. 

He entered into a very large room, crates and empty shelves lined the walls, waiting to be filled. A new potted plant was close to the door - Arden vowed to care for this one more than his previous, which had died a very dry death after he had forgotton about it for several weeks. A brand new dining table and chairs were elegantly positioned for entertaining guest, a possibility Arden greatly looked foward to, and behind it was a window. Amazed, Arden ran towards it to see that it overlooked a beautiful garden with a magnificent statue standing in the center. He went through the door and through the luscious garden into a storage room and then through another door which led to a plush, comfy looking bed. He jumped on it and smelt the new sheets before pushing himself up and entering into a large, gleaming bathroom. He turned and left, wondering what other fantastic things his new apartment could behold.

After another exploration, he found a couple of thrones, made a mental note to find a queen and had a cup of tea. Now wondering where all of his possessions were, he went to go and ask Darlin, the elderly apartment seller, only to see the crate which he had earlier missed by the door. Levering it open, he looked inside, appalled. "Oh tosh," he uttered aloud, "how shall I ever sort this out?"

<t t="On Dwarven Culture and History, Vol. IV"><p>
Dwarves were once known for being the race with the most gender equality. For them a dwarf was a dwarf. It didn't matter what else they were as long as they had the traditional dwarvish beard, an axe and mining skill. Anyone could become the next Dwarf King, a position at least 3 dwarves of the female persuasion have once held. The only instance where gender even came into play was in the traditional ritual of beardlock where two dwarves would pledge to spend their lives together.

However this is no longer true. Roughly 100 years ago an extremist sect that practiced male supremacy took over dwarvish society. Gone were the days when anyone could be a mine overseer or even wield an axe. Now it was limited to men. Even more cruelly they even performed the barbaric custom of shaving off a female dwarf's beard, a practice more commonly known by the term "Female Dwarf Mutilation".

Now dwarvish society has completely changed. While in the olden days a female dwarf could aspire to become the next Dwarf King, now they can only aim for exalted positions such as "Comber of the Mine Overseer's Feet" where they groom the hair growing on their Overseer's feet or the heavily sought after position of "Brewer's Lackey" where they're even permitted to sip from the ale deemed not fit for consumption.

Whether dwarf society will change in future is unknown but according to most male dwarves both male and female dwarves are happy with current arrangement.

<t t="The Mugwump's Talisman"><p>
It is said that the best gift to give to fair maiden you wish to pursue is a Mugwump Amulet. A Mugwump will shed its skin when it grows to maturity and wear it around its neck as a protective talisman. Thus every year young men will go hunting for an amulet to give to their loved ones. However it has sparked controversy among some groups who claim Mugwumps should be protected as endangered species. (Treddius the Fat, "Of Mugwumps", year 80 AE)
