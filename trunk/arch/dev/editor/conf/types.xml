# types.xml - This is the definitions-file for all the different     #
# Daimonin object types and their attributes.                        #
#                                                                    #
# The server code of the Daimonin game is always changing and        #
# evolving. From time to time, object-attributes change in purpose,  #
# or new ones are created.                                           #
# Therefore, it is important that an Editor is flexible and          #
# easy to "upgrade" to handle such new features. That's why the      #
# DaimoninEditor reads the type-definitions from this xml file.      #
#                                                                    #
# If you encounter bugs, typos or missing entries in the LATEST      #
# VERSION of this file - Don't hesitate to improve it, contact me    #
# and eventually send the improved file to me: <red.blaze@gmx.net>.  #
# I will put it into the "official version" of the DaimoninEditor    #
# and all fellow Daimonin-Map-Makers can benefit from your work!     #
#                                                                    #

<!--###################### default attributes ######################-->

<!--
  The attributes of the default_type get added to all other types by default.
  Every type can have an 'ignore' element however, which is used to specify
  default attributes *not* to inherit. Attributes explicitly defined in a type
  are not inherited.
  -->
<default_type>
  <attribute arch="name" editor="name" type="string">
    This is the name of the object, displayed to the player.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="title" editor="title" type="string">
    This is the object's title. Once an object is identified the title is
    attached to the name. Typical titles are "of mostrai", "of xray vision" etc.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="amask" editor="artifact mask" type="string">
	This is the name of a artifact mask which alters the original arch with the
    values defined for that artifact in the artifacts file. The item is altered
    AFTER all other attributes, even those following behind the artifact mask, are loaded.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="sub_type" editor="sub type" type="int">
    This important value is used to define "sub types" for objects of the same object
    type. Examples are weapons, which are all from type WEAPON but can be different sub types
    like slash type, cleave type, 1hand, polearms and so on. This value goes to the client
    too. WARNING: not all objects have a sub_type and changing it without care can corrupt
    server AND/OR the clients. Normally this is not a subject to change outside arch definition.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="layer" editor="layer" type="int">
    This is the map layer, the object will put in. The selected layer will effect where and
    how this object is shown on client side. Layer 0 is reserved for sys_object type objects
    and will NEVER be shown on client side.
    Layer 3 and 4 are for items on the ground. Layer 5 is for walls, layer
    6 is reserved for players and layer 7 is for spell effects and high flying/visible
    objects like arrows.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="face" editor="image" type="facename">
    The image-name defines what image is displayed for this object
    in-game.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="animation" editor="animation" type="animname">
    The animation-name defines what animation is displayed for this object
    in-game. Note that a set animation will overrule the face.
    Changing animation is easy - adding or deleting a animation is more
    difficult and should be done in the text parse window and not in this
    dialog.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="anim_speed" editor="anim speed" type="int">
  How fast to play this animation.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_animated" editor="is animated" type="bool">
  If set, the object is animated and animation is used.
  Note: Some special objects will use a animation NOT as animation but
  as frame list. Examples are buttons (which frames are changed by the
  object status of the button). IS_TURNABLE will enable direction turning
  for some object types. These flags are all "system" related. Be VERY
  careful to change them.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="is_turnable" editor="is turnable" type="bool">
  System flag. Object can be turned to the directions.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="terrain_flag" editor="can move on" type="bitmask_terrain">
    Defines on which kind of terrain this object can move/be moved.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="speed_left" editor="start speed" type="float">
    NOTE: without speed != 0, this value is not used. Only use
    for objects with speed (active objects)!
    When a active object (with 'speed' != 0) is put on a map, this
    value is used as counter. Every 'tick', 'speed' (if negative,
    value is turned positive before) is added to this value -
    if it is bigger 0 the object 'will do something' and this counter is
    decreased with -1.0 .
    As default a normal object will put on the map with start speed 0.
    It 'will do something' with the next coming 'tick'.
    Setting this value to -1.0 will put it on map but wait one full
    'lifetime' round until it does something.
    A 'fire object' should be put on map with start speed 0 - it should
    try to burn something in the moment it comes in the game. A bomb for
    example should be put with speed -1.0 on the map - it will stay then
    on map until the bomb becomes active - it explode.
    The 'lifetime' round is determinated by speed. A speed of 1.0 will
    give a 'lifetime' round of 1 tick - a speed of 0.01 100 ticks.
    Special case: A negative speed value will add to start speed a random
    value between 0.0 to 0.9 . So, a speed of -0.1 with a start speed of
    -1.0 will result in speed 0.1 and start speed between -1.0 and -0.1.
    This is useful to lets a row of same objects act in different tick ranges.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="nrof" editor="number" type="int">
    This value determines the number of objects in one stack (for example:
    100 gold coins =&gt; "number = 100"). You should set this at least to one, for
    any pickable object - otherwise it won't be mergeable into a stack.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="weight" editor="weight" type="int">
    This value defines the object's weight in grams (1000g is 1kg). Objects with
    zero weight are not pickable for players. Still, set the "non-pickable"-flag
    for explicitly non-pickable objects (hey, this is open source.. you
    never know ;) ).
    It takes about 1 point of player str per 50000g to push an object.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="value" editor="value" type="long">
    Adds a certain value to the object: It will be worth that many times the
    default value from it's archetype (E.g. "value = 3" means three times
    worth the default value). Value for buying/selling will be
    further modified by various factors. Hence, testing values in-game is
    usually inevitable.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="material" editor="material class" type="bitmask_material">
    This bitmask-value informs the player of which basic material(s)
    the object consists. Material class does also affect how likely the
    object can be destroyed by hazardous spell-effects.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="material_real" editor="material" type="list_material_real">
    The material defines the exact material of which the object
    consists. It is much more specific than &lt;material class&gt;,
    however only one material can be selected, not multiple.
    &lt;material&gt; is not required to be set, it can be left 'undefined'.
    A value of -1 will disable it and avoid every "material" setting or prefix
    when the object is loaded.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="glow_radius" editor="glow radius" type="int">
    If &lt;glow radius&gt; is set to a value greater zero, the object
    appears lit up on dark maps. &lt;glow radius&gt; can be a value
    between 0 and 9, the higher, the more light does the object emit.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="can_stack" editor="stackable" type="bool">
    If set, the item can be stacked. Careful, don't use on
    rings or other applyable items, it will lead to side effects.
    Arrows are designed to be used as stack.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_pick" editor="non-pickable" type="bool">
    If set, the object cannot be picked up (Neither by players nor monsters).
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_pass" editor="blocking passage" type="bool">
    If set, the object cannot be passed by players nor monsters.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="blocksview" editor="block view" type="bool">
    If an item is set to block view, players (and monsters) cannot
    see beyond it unless they cross it or manage to stand on top.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="pass_ethereal" editor="etheral can pass" type="bool">
    If no_pass (blocking passage) is set, no one can pass. If this
    flag is set too, ethereal flagged objects and CAN_PASS_THRU flag can pass.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="pass_thru" editor="can pass (no ethereal)" type="bool">
    If no_pass (blocking passage) is set, no one can pass. If this
    flag is set too, objects with the CAN_PASS_THRU flag can pass.
    Ethereal can't pass this as long pass_ethereal is not set!
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_magic" editor="no spells" type="bool">
    If enabled, it is impossible for players to use (wizard-)
    spells on that spot.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="no_cleric" editor="no prayers" type="bool">
    If enabled, it is impossible for players to use (cleric-)
    prayers on that spot.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="player_only" editor="player only" type="bool">
    If set, only players can enter the tile the object with this flag is in too.
  </attribute>
</default_type>

<!-- This ignorelist is for all system objects which are non pickable
     and invisible. They don't interact with players at all. -->

    Abilities are to be put in a monster's inventory. They grant monsters the
    knowledge to cast spells. Spells from abilities are usually magical in
    nature, thus adding magic to the spell-damage they produce. If not marked
    as magical, the ability as natural effect can't be disenchanted or
    blocked by dispel magic.
    <br><br>
    A particularly nice feature of abilities is that they can hold two
    spells: One for short range- and one for long range use.
    <br><br>
    You should know that spellcasting monsters receive abilities via
    &lt;treasurelist&gt;.  ]]>
  </description>
  <use><![CDATA[
    If you want to create "customized" spellcasting monsters, you
    should use abilities (rather than spellbooks/wands or something).
    The long/short-range spell feature can make boss-monsters more
    interesting and challenging.
    <br><br>
    You should keep in mind that magic abilities allow players
    to get better resistance. You can turn off the magic part to
    make the spells more dangerous. However, this really shouldn't
    be necessary unless you work on very high level maps.

    Altar_triggers work pretty much like normal altars

    Altar_triggers are very useful if you want to charge a price for...

    <LI> ...information. -&gt; Connect the altar_trigger (set "last_sp 1") to a magic_mouth.

    The big advantage over normal altars is the infinite usability

    Remember to put a note somewhere, telling the player what he is

    If this attribute is disabled (default), the altar_trigger
    will push the connected value TWICE per sacrifice: First by
    dropping sacrifice, second by reset. This mode is typically
    used for altars being connected to gates, resulting in the

  <attribute arch="item_quality" editor="max. quality %" type="int">
    Every item has a natural material quality, ranging from 0 top 100.
    This is a % factor, which affects the base stats of the item.
    However, &lt;max. quality&gt; does not represent the actual state of the
    item but the best &lt;actual quality&gt; value this item can ever have.

    Basic quality is 80%. If the item is made of cheap material, the
    value may be lower. If made of very fine material it may be 100%.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="item_condition" editor="condition %" type="int">
    This is the REAL quality status of item - showing how much it is
    used up. Every time the item is overused or damaged, the
    &lt;actual quality&gt; is lowered. The value can range from 0 (destroyed) to
    the maximum of &lt;max. quality&gt; (It can never get higher than that).
    The quality value represents a % value affecting the item's stats:
    Lower quality than 100% means effects like protection/damage etc.
    are reduced.

    Horns are very similar to rods. The difference is that horns regenerate
    spellpoints faster and thus are more valuable than rods.

    A horn contains a spell. The player can use this spell by applying and
    "fireing" (blowing) the horn. Unlike wands/scrolls, horns can be
    used endlessly. ]]>

    Inventory checkers passively check the players inventory for a
    specific object. You can set a connected value that is triggered
    either if that object is present or missing (-&gt; "last_sp") when a
    player walks over the inv. checker. A valid option is to remove the
    matching object (usually not recommended, see "last_heal").
    <br><br>
    Alternatively, you can set your inv. checker to block all players
    that do/don't carry the matching object (-&gt; "no_pass").
    <br><br>
    As you can see, inv. checkers are quite powerful, holding a
    great variety of possibilities. ]]>

    Putting a check_inventory space in front of a gate (one below) and

  <use><![CDATA[
    Spellcasting walls pose an interesting alternative to monsters.
    Usually they are set to be undestroyable ("alive 0"). Thus, while
    monsters in a map can be cleared out, the magic walls remain. Low
    level characters for example will not be able to pass through their
    spell-area, hence they cannot loot a map that a high level character
    might have cleared out.
    <br><br>
    Another point of magic walls is that if the player dies, he has to face
    them all again. Magic walls can add a kind of "permanent thrill" to
    your maps.

    Monsters play a central role in most maps. Choosing the right
    combination of monsters for your map is vital:
    <UL>
    <LI> Place only monsters of slightly varying (increasing) strength.
         It's no fun to play for two hours just to find out the last
         monster is unbeatable. Similar, it's not exciting to fight orcs
         after passing a room of dragons.<br>
         This rule applies only for linear maps (one room after the other),
         with treasure at the end. You can sprinkle the treasure around,
         or make non-linear maps - That is often more entertaining.
    <LI> Places with high level monsters must not be easy to reach.
         Balrogs, Dragonmen and the likes should be at the end of a quest,
         not at the beginning.
    <LI> Don't stick monsters together that tend to kill each other.
         Fire- and cold dragons in one room for example is a bad idea.
         By weakening and killing each other they are easy prey for players,
         not worth the experience they hold.
    <LI> Create your own monsters, especially for "boss"-type monsters.
         Having stage-bosses guarding treasure is a lot of fun when done right.
         Avoid to create monsters with completely non-intuitive abilities:
         Don't give ice-spells to fire dragons or vice versa. Don't add
         draining attack to trolls, etc. Additionally, you should inform the
         player before he bumps right into some very special/unusual monster.
    <LI> Last but not least: Always keep an eye on the experience your monsters
         hold. Design your maps in a way that high experience
         is always well-defended. Don't make large rooms full with only one kind
         of monster. Keep in mind the different abilities/techniques players
         can use.
    </UL>
    I know it's impossible to make the perfectly balanced map. There's always
    some part which is found too easy or too hard for a certain kind of player.
    Just give it your best shot. And listen to feedback from players if you
    receive some. :-) ]]>

    If the start value is negative (like -0.1) then the speed is set to

    Like players, monsters need &lt;spellpoints&gt; to do magic. Monsters use

    When creating a spellcasting monster, remember that &lt;max spellpoints&gt;
    and &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; are more important.

  <attribute arch="maxsp" editor="max spellpoints" type="int">

    "regenerate mana" at it's disposal.

    Important: This is a relative value, dependant on monster level.
    The in-game value is calculated as follows:

  <attribute arch="pow" editor="spellpoint regen." type="int">
    Monsters regenerate this many spellpoints each move. Each time the
    monster has a move, it gets &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; spellpoints back.
    Hence, &lt;movement speed&gt; has great effect on the monster's
    spellpoint regeneration as well.

    To make a real tough spellcasting monster, the rate of spellpoint
    regeneration is most important. If your monster is still not casting
    fast enough, give it the spell-ability of "regenerate mana".
    That, paired with high &lt;max spellpoints&gt;, is the ultimate thing.

    Monsters play a central role in most maps. Choosing the right
    combination of monsters for your map is vital:
    <UL>
    <LI> Place only monsters of slightly varying (increasing) strength.
         It's no fun to play for two hours just to find out the last
         monster is unbeatable. Similar, it's not exciting to fight orcs
         after passing a room of dragons.<br>
         This rule applies only for linear maps (one room after the other),
         with treasure at the end. You can sprinkle the treasure around,
         or make non-linear maps - That is often more entertaining.
    <LI> Places with high level monsters must not be easy to reach.
         Balrogs, Dragonmen and the likes should be at the end of a quest,
         not at the beginning.
    <LI> Don't stick monsters together that tend to kill each other.
         Fire- and cold dragons in one room for example is a bad idea.
         By weakening and killing each other they are easy prey for players,
         not worth the experience they hold.
    <LI> Create your own monsters, especially for "boss"-type monsters.
         Having stage-bosses guarding treasure is a lot of fun when done right.
         Avoid to create monsters with completely non-intuitive abilities:
         Don't give ice-spells to fire dragons or vice versa. Don't add
         draining attack to trolls, etc. Additionally, you should inform the
         player before he bumps right into some very special/unusual monster.
    <LI> Last but not least: Always keep an eye on the experience your monsters
         hold. Design your maps in a way that high experience
         is always well-defended. Don't make large rooms full with only one kind
         of monster. Keep in mind the different abilities/techniques players
         can use.
    </UL>
    I know it's impossible to make the perfectly balanced map. There's always
    some part which is found too easy or too hard for a certain kind of player.
    Just give it your best shot. And listen to feedback from players if you
    receive some. :-) ]]>
  </use>
  <attribute arch="alive" value="1" type="fixed" />
  <attribute arch="randomitems" editor="treasurelist" type="string">
    When the monster is killed, items from the treasurelist will
    drop to the ground. This is a common way to reward players

    Note that you can always put items into the monster's
    inventory. Those will drop-at-kill just like the stuff
    from the &lt;treasurelist&gt;.

    Every monster should have a race set to categorize it.

    Slaying weapons inflict triple damage against enemy races
    and holy word kills only enemy races of the god.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="exp" editor="experience" type="int">
    When a player kills this monster, he will get exactly this
    amount of &lt;experience&gt;. The experience will flow into
    the skill-category the player used for the kill.

    If you create special monsters of tweaked strength/abilities,
    always make sure that the &lt;experience&gt; is set to a
    reasonable value. Compare with existing arches to get a feeling
    what reasonable means. Keep in mind that spellcasting monsters
    are a lot harder to kill than non-spellcasters!

    should not be used.

    If no_pass (blocking passage) is set for a object, no one can pass
    the tile is it in (true for walls or closed doors). But if this

    which has pass_thru set.

    Like players, monsters need &lt;spellpoints&gt; to do magic. Monsters use

    When creating a spellcasting monster, remember that &lt;max spellpoints&gt;

  <attribute arch="maxsp" editor="max spellpoints" type="int">
    &lt;max spellpoints&gt; is the maximum number of spellpoints a monster

    "regenerate mana" at it's disposal.

    Important: This is a relative value, dependant on monster level.
    The in-game value is calculated as follows:
    "real max spellpoints" = &lt;max spellpoints&gt; * (&lt;level&gt; + 1)

  <attribute arch="pow" editor="spellpoint regen." type="int">
    Monsters regenerate this many spellpoints each move. Each time the
    monster has a move, it gets &lt;spellpoint regen.&gt; spellpoints back.
    Hence, &lt;movement speed&gt; has great effect on the monster's
    spellpoint regeneration as well.

    To make a real tough spellcasting monster, the rate of spellpoint
    regeneration is most important. If your monster is still not casting
    fast enough, give it the spell-ability of "regenerate mana".
    That, paired with high &lt;max spellpoints&gt;, is the ultimate thing.

  <use><![CDATA[
    Mood floors are absolutely cool for NPC interaction. To make an
    unaggressive monster/NPC attack, put a creator with "other_arch
    furious_floor" under it. Connect the creator to a magic_ear, so the
    player speaks a keyword like "stupid sucker" - and the monster attacks.
    <br><br>
    To turn an NPC into a pet, put a charm_floor under it and connect
    it directly to a magic_ear. Then the player speaks a keyword like
    "help me" - and the NPC joins him as pet.
    <br><br>

    Schooting weapons like bows/crossbows are used to shoot projectiles
    (arrows/bolts). Shooting weapons and normal (melee) weapons can be
    wielded both at the same time. Like with any other equipment,

    It's very easy to add new pairs of weapons &amp; projectiles.

    weapon and projectile. ]]>

    Shooting weapons should not add bonuses in general. There's already

    Schooting weapons should especially not add bonuses to the player
    that have nothing to do with shooting. A Wisdom bonus on a bow
    is crap for example! A name like "Longbow of great Wisdom" doesn't help
    - still crap. ]]>

    The purpose of a sign or magic_mouth is to display a certain message to
    the player. There are three ways to have the player get this message:
    The player walking onto it (-&gt; magic_mouth), the player pressing &lt;a&gt;pply
    (-&gt; sign) or the player triggering a button/handle/etc (-&gt; magic_mouth). ]]>

    Use signs and magic_mouths, plenty of them! Place magic_mouths to add

    When a connection value is set, the message will be printed whenever
    the connection is triggered. This should be used in combination with
    &lt;invisible&gt; enabled and &lt;activate by walking/flying&gt; disabled.
    If activating your magic_mouth this way, the message will not only be
    printed to one player, but all players on the current map.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="walk_on" editor="activate by walking" type="bool">
    If set, the player gets the message when walking on top of the object.
    This is the typical configuration
    for a "magic_mouth": The player walks through a dungeon and suddenly he
    gets a message. Use this to create some roleplay atmosphere, and to inform
    the player about possible dangers or secrets.
  </attribute>
  <attribute arch="fly_on" editor="activate by flying" type="bool">

    If a counter-value is set (greater zero), the sign/magic_mouth can be applied
    (printing the message) only that many times. For signs this really shouldn't
    be used, while for magic_mouths it is extremely helpful.
    Monsters walking over the magic_mouth do not decrease the counter.

    Often, you might want to have a message displayed only one time. For example:
    The player enters your map and you put a magic_mouth to tell him about the
    monsters and how dangerous they look and all. Later, when all the monsters
    are killed and the player leaves the map, displaying the same message a
    second time would be silly. &lt;counter&gt; 1 does a perfect job in such cases.
    Otherwise set &lt;counter&gt; zero/unset for infinite use (that is the default).

    only monsters of that archetype are hit with triple damage.
