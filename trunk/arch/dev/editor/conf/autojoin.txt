# autojoin.txt - This file contains data about which (wall-)arches belong
# together and in which directions they point. That is used by the
# CFJavaEditor to determine how to join walls in the autojoining mode.
# Feel free to modify this file to suite your needs.
#
# The file must be kept in the following format:
# Arches of same joining type must be grouped into sections. A new section
# is started by "start", then arch names get listed, 16 total -
# one per line. The section is followed by "end".
# The arch names must be listed in the following order
# (0 = no connection, N = north, E = east, S = south, W = west):
#
# 0, N, E, NE, S, NS, ES, NES, W, WN, WE, WNE, SW, SWN, ESW, NESW
#
# Autojoining works with anything except multisquare arches.
