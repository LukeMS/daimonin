These 'objects' are only used to hold the face/snimation of opened containers;
no other attribute is used by the server.

I think these must be from CF days which obviously handled containers
differently.

The fact that some files/objects are called close (eg, saddle_close).arc just
adds to the confusion 

The fact that other files are called open but define an object called close (eg,
open_sack.arc) is taking the piss.
