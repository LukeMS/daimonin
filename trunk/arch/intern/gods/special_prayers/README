Inserting this spells in the treasure list of a god
will give the god the power to give these spells to
his followers.

Depending on luck and the set level of the spell,
a player get one or more of these spells when
he prays (apply) a altar of his god.

These spells are called "special prayers" because when
given a player, the player also get a force object, which
marks this spell as "special". If the player change his
deity, the force is removed AND the spell with the same
name too.
