# This is a client3d description file for an ogre3d model.
# This file is part of Daimonin (http://daimonin.sourceforge.net)
##################################################################################
# IMPORTANT:
# Every model MUST have an animation-state IDLE1 !!!!!
# If you don't have IDLE1 ready yet -> fill it with something that exist.
#
# The animation states are CASE SENSITIVE!
#
# In future there will be fixed names for animation states.
# Therefore the animation-state should ALWAYS be named like the function.
# e.g. "Walk1" for Walk1. NOT "Walk" like in the original ogre3d robot-model.
#
# Post all comments to the daimonin devel-list.
