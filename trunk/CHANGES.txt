                - added level depending damage bonus (if the attacker has
                  ( a higher level as the target, there will be a special dmg bonus)

                - removed refcount from object structure (unusued).
                - fixed a memset bug in player struct!
		- fixed and extended merging (stacking of items)

28.10.2003 	- added 2 new types to make jewels and nuggets different from 
  		  gems. That will allow native and improved use from artifct
  		  file for each type - also very useful for later trade skill use.
		- added t_style and artifact_chance to treasure file & artifact file.
		- added sys_object arrows for mobs. If a arrow is sys_objectz marked 
                  which a mobs is firing, the arrow is duped and food is set to x.
                  if a arrow is "stopped" and food there, the arrow is marked no_pick 1
                  and is_used_up is set. This allow infinitive, self destructing arrows.

25.10.2003	changed exit marker to unique map from unique 1 to
                last_eat 1. This avoided that normal exits (aka default
                map objects) are saved in unique map files.
