Artits Credits of the Daimonin Projects
---------------------------------------

The art of the daimonin package comes from this artists or sources.

Please note that this file will not tell you which single picture will
come from which source. The Daimonin art files include some thousand
single files which are often copied and altered. If you want trace which 
files comes from which source, you have to ask or look for yourself.

Note also, that we have not copied every author from other projects
we included in Daimonin. For example is there a big pile of artists which
has build up the art collection of Crossfire. Because Daimonin is a split
of crossfire, we will give credits to the crossfire project itself. If there
is special work for the Daimonin project itself from a crossfire artist, he/she
is listed then twice.


IMPORTANT:

If you find art from a source in the daimonin art files which is not listed here 
(but should listed) or you find art from YOURSELF in the daimonin art files and
you are not listed here... Then please contact the daimonin dev team or email direct
to daimonin@nord-com.net!! We are VERY sorry we forget to credit you!
 
EVERYONE which has contributed art to daimonin has the RIGHT to be listed here.
But sometimes it is hard to contact a author or find the source of art which is
dropped in the net for free. Please note that we really try to contact or credit
every source. When there credit or copyright problems please contact the daimonin
team ASAP too! MT.

A different point is copyright art claimed by others as free. IF someone has
stolen YOUR (copyright and/or not free) art and you find it in Daimonin - 
contact us ASAP. You can be sure that we will NEVER use non free art on purpose.
For some reason some people try to steal art and give it out as their work. We
have the same interest as you to find this art & people and clear the situation.
We will always help you to find these kind of imposters so you can start the
actions against them. Count this as warning to all who trade in stolen art.

A word of warning: There are alot of websites out trading so called "free art".
Under fantasy animals or monsters you will find on many of these sites a 
red dragon animation rated as "free for all". This dragon is art from
the Ultima Online(tm) MMORPG from Origin (tm) (Electronic Arts (tm)) and
NOT free - its a copyright protected art rip off from a still running & selled 
commercial game. You will find on this sites many other arts from this game 
and also many art from games like Diablo (tm). That the copyright holding companies
tolerate these "half private use" more or less is a nice move but of course 
this kind of art has NO PLACE in a open source project and its illegal to use it.

Another note: Stealing art is even in the commercial world a problem. Very often
artists show game companies art which are not from them to get a job or work. 
Verifying the source of art is ALWAYS a good idea.
