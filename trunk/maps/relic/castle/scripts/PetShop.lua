Pets are loyal companions that follow you around and help you out 
in your adventures.

If you get in a fight, they will try to help you out by attacking 
your targets. They will also defend themselves if attacked.

Remember that pets are not always easy to control. They have a 
mind of their own and can even rebel upon you if you abuse them.
Make sure to take care of your pet and heal it when needed.">
