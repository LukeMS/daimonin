Welcome to Daimonin BETA 2

Read first README - it will give you a overview about this package.

In every main folder is usually a README.txt file - read it!
It will guide you through the specific folders and their content.

CLIENT:
To start a client, you need under win32 (Windows 98, NT, XP...) nothing
but the binary package. Download it and run the installer.
You can start it out of the box. 

For linux or a source package, you need some libraries too. Read the
README.txt in /client/make and follow what it tells. 

A note to *unix users:
The Daimonins SDL client runs under linux for example with the same speed,
features and quality as under DirectX - but you have to install a low
level sound and graphic driver system first (like openGL for example)!

The SDL client is a "real" game application and will take heavy advantage
from it because the SDL library will use always the "best" installed 
drivers it can be found. If there are no one, the SDL library will fall down
to normal X-GUI functions - and thats pretty slow. Note that i have run the 
client on my system with openGL and Slackware linux with >100 fps.
Graphic Card manufactors like Nvidia will provide native drivers for linux 
and some other OS. And don't forget the sound! Daimonin has a great
sound interface and use it as integrated engine part. You will miss alot
of gaming experience without sound.


SERVER:
To start a Daimon server, you need a installed PYTHON script engine.
You can download the python script engine from the python homepage:
