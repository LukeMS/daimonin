Daimonin TODO

21.09.2003 - rework move_gate() and move_timed_gate() - see notes in move_gate().
             add gate_close/gate_open sound. (sound added to client).
25.09.2003 - encumberace is still bound to the REAL speed of the object - and the real speed
             of the player object effects the poll of the socket - thats NOT good and a 
             design flaw. In old cf days, this was senseful - today is not.

20.10.2003 - monster.c/can_detect_enemy() - rework this function

25.10.2003 - unique maps: must rework ready_map... to handle unique, random and
             group maps more senseful. 

25.10.2003 - appartment are identified by use settings.localdir... very bad - change
             this to a mapflag.

KNOWN BUGS:
24.09.2003 - there seems a little bug in the target system, sometimes a possible target
             is not selected.
