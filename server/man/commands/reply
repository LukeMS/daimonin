 ***** reply command *****

syntax: /reply message

this command allows to reply to 
the last player that has send you 
private message.

'message' is the text you want to 
send back.

IMPORTANT: this commands allows for
private conversations. no other player
than 'player_name' is able to listen
to this message.
also, be careful with /reply. this 
command tends to mess up things when 
you are talking with more than 1 person
via private messages.
