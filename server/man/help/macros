1. Description
Macro is a helpful way to reduce
ingame typing. It allows to bind 
long commands to single keys.
Macros are useful in, for example, 
spellcasting.

2. How-to
To setup new macro, enter 'Macros' 
dialog box by hitting F11. 
Then, select one of the tabs by 
using cusror keys (up and down) with
SHIFT key down.
Next, enter first empty line (without
shift key) and hit ENTER. Type the 
macro command of you choice. Examples
are in the next section.
After accepting with next ENTER hit,
you will be asked about key you want 
to bind new macro to.
One last thing to do is to choose 
wether macro should be 'repeatable'
or not. Do it by right-clicking on 
last column of table. Doing so, 
toggles 'on' or 'off' value.
IMPORTANT: Do not press ESCAPE to 
exit current dialog box. Hit 'Done'
button, in down-left dialog side.
Otherwise, client won't save new 
entries.

3. Examples of macros

These is small set of predefined
macros already set up for you.
One of them, used to pray, is:
(macro)       (key)    (repeat)
/pray           p           off

To construct spellcasting macros,
use the same format and choose your
keys.
Here is a list of currently usable 
macro commands:
/cast magic bullet
/cast cause light wounds
/cast probe
/cast minor healing
/use_skill remove traps
/use_skill find traps

You can also use macro, for example,
to shout or say:
/shout buying good items

Just dont overuse /shout macros, 
most player dont like spamming.
Generally, try to keep 'repeat' value
set to 'off' for /shout macros.
