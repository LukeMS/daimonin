To use a spell, you can either use the range system or type "/cast <spellname>". 
If you type it in, then you will fire in the direction that you are facing. 
If it's a friendly spell, then it will auto-target you. 
To use the range system, look at the top right corner of your screen for a button that is labled "spells".
Click on that to open your spell window. 
Locate the spell that you are going to use (if you have any yet) and click on it. 
A little picture will light up. Click on that and it will automatically ready it for casting. 
Now all that you need to do is hold control and then direct the spell with the numberpad.
