/* DAI_VERSION_INTERIM is a string constant ("a", "b", etc -- longer strings,
 * up to about 16 characters, are possible but it is wisest to stick to single
 * characters) or the empty string. Where it is a constant, it indicates that
 * this is an interim server version. This is necessary because the
 * DAI_VERSION_* defines in protocol.h define the x.y.z version of both client
 * and server and therefore require a new client release for the autoupdater.
 * While it has always been possible to independently patch just the server
 * (so-called 'hotfixes') the problem was that players had no clue, beyond the
 * actual hotfix -- which of course may not really be player-noticeable, that
 * anything at all had changed. Thus confusion reigned.
 *
 * When a new x.y.z release is made, DAI_VERSION_INTERIM must be reset to "".
 * In fact, in trunk, this value should always be "". It (and it is the only
 * bit of code for which this is true) should only ever be directly changed in
 * main.
 *
 * So while trunk is 0.10.6, main may be 0.10.5 or 0.10.5/a to 0.10.5/z. When
 * server-only changes from trunk are merger to main this interim version is
 * bumped on main. Trunk remains at 0.10.6. When a new x.y.z is released (so
 * client too), main is bumped to 0.10.6 (the interim is reset to "") and trunk
 * is bumped to 0.10.7 and the process repeats. */

/* NON-SCALAR TYPES (structs and unions):

 * Note: While this is actually relevant tooo the struct declarationss, not the
 * typedefs, this is a nice central place to mention it.
 *
 * Use (at least) basic structure packing techniques to squeeze structures into
 * as small a memory foo;;tprint as possible. Here is a very readable resource
 * on this subject: http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/
 *
 * I think two things about this are important to stress.
 *
 * Firstly, while it is definitely worthwhile to remove/reduce unnecessary
 * padding on very often-used structures (such as map_t, msp_t, and object_t),
 * the saving per structure is only going to be a few bytes and this may seem
 * pointless when a new feature (such as msp_t being able to back reference its
 * map, x, y in 0.10.7) can add this and more, but that's useful, padding
 * isn't.
 *
 * Secondly, structure packing is an art, not a science. A very tightly packed
 * structure that is totally unreadable/unmaintainable as a result is of
 * dubious benefit. Also, keep in mind the memory cache. This is a complex
 * subject in detail but the basics seem simple enough: when a program first
 * accesses a specific address in memory (ie, a struct), a given block of that
 * memory -- the cache line, allegedly usually 32 or 64 bytes, depending on
 * architecture -- is copied into the cache. Subsequent operations work on this
 * cache, if available, first. Therefore it improves access times to put the
 * most commonly accessed members within the cache line.
 *
 * Older code tended (inconsistently) to use #pragma pack (on Windows). Don't
 * do this. */

/* The TPR_*() macros are for timing code execution (TPR stands for Time Per
 * Repetition).
 *
 * There are four macros, TPR_START(), TPR_STOP(), TPR_BREAK(), and
 * TPR_GETDEVIATION(). Of these, you must use the first two. The third is
 * optional but may be used multiple times, and the fOurth is for internal use
 * only (you never call it directly).
 *
 * Usage is pretty simple. The macros are designed to time a function or part
 * thereof. Of course this may (likely will) call other functions but the point
 * is, each 'set' of calls must be within the same function.
 *
 * At the head of the function but after any function-wide automatic variable
 * declarations, or from wherever you want to start timing execution, call
 * TPR_START().
 *
 * At the foot of the function but before the final return, or wherever you
 * want to finish timing exeecution, call TPR_STOP(S).
 * 
 * Between these two, 0-n times, you may call TPR_BREAK(S).
 *
 * STOP and BREAK both log a message which gives some basic info and the time
 * (in seconds and microseconds) that has elapsed between when you called START
 * and now (the deviation). S is a string to help you identify what is going
 * on.
 *
 * STOP and BREAK are actually functionally nearly identical ATM. Nevertheless
 * you should use the appropriate0 one as described above.

/* The FOREACH macros provide a convenient and understandable way to write a
 * code block which steps through each object in a given context.
 *
 * FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_OBJECT() will go through every object in the inventory of
 * another.
 *
 * FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_MSP() will go through every object in a map square. Note
 * that this begins the loop at the real object (that is not system object) end
 * of the list. (Almost?) Always when looking for a system object on a map
 * square, you're only interested in if there is a specific one or not and it
 * is better to use MSP_GET_SYS_OBJECT().
 *
 * FOREACH_PART_OF_OBJECT() will go through each part of a multipart object
 * (working its way towards the tail).
 *
 * All macros take 3 arguments. The 1st, _OC_, and 3rd, _ON_, are object_t *. 
 * These values will be overwritten each loop, with _OC_ pointing to the
 * child object under consideration or NULL and _ON_ pointing to the next one
 * or NULL. Note that it is fine to remove_ob() the child object each iteration
 * (but do not destroy the heirarchy further than the current child or the loop
 * will fail).
 *
 * The 2nd argument of FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_OBJECT(), _OP_, is also object_t *.
 * This is the parent object whose inventory we are looping through. Note that
 * the macro is not recursive; if _OC_ has an inventory we do not loop through
 * it (such behaviour is very easy to write in specific situations though).
 *
 * The 2nd argument of FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_MSP(), _MSP_, is msp_t *. This is
 * the map square whose contents we are looping through. Note that _OC_/_ON_
 * point to actual objects in _MSP_ and do not determine if they are singlepart
 * or part of a multipart. This is very easy to write in specific situations
 * though.
 *
 * The 2nd argument of FOREACH_PART_OF_OBJECT(), _OP_, is an object_t *. This
 * is the part (usually the head) from which we start browsing.
 *
 * So you will often find code like this (where what is a preset object_t *):
 *
 * object_t *this,
 *          *next;
 *
 * FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_OBJECT(this, what, next)
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * Or this (where msp is a preset msp_t *):
 *
 * object_t *this,
 *          *next;
 *
 * FOREACH_OBJECT_IN_MSP(this, msp, next)
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * Or this (where what is a preset object_t *):
 *
 * object_t *this,
 *          *next;
 *
 * FOREACH_PART_OF_OBJECT(this, what, next)
 * {
 *     ...
 * }
 * */
