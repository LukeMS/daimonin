How to Install the Daimonin Server

Note: The server source is not ported to as many OS as the SDL client.
      If you want to try to port the server to a new OS, please contact 
      the dev team.

Note: The files inside the /install folder are the default files for a 
      server installation. Please don't change the files inside this folder,
      you will find them after the install inside the /data folder where you 
      can access them.

Select the OS you need to install the package. If you can't find the OS
you want install the server, the source is not ported to this OS.

Enter the folder and read the README.txt inside. For most OS, you have to run
a install script or a batch file.

If you don't have a binary package, you need to compile the server source first.

Source packages have a /make and a /src folder inside the Daimonin/server
folder.

If you have problems to install the package, contact the
Daimonin dev team for more infos:
