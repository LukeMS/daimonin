How to Install the Daimonin Server

Note: The server source is not ported to as many OS as the SDL client.
      If you want to try to port the server to a new OS, please contact
      the dev team.

Note: The files inside the /install folder are the default files for a
      server installation. Please don't change the files inside this folder,
      you will find them after the install inside the /data folder where you
      can access them.

Note: The files in the /lib folder are necessary to run the server 'out of the
      box'. However these files (the arch collection and some settings files)
      are not kept up-to-date so for most uses you will need to recollect the
      arches with Gridarta and copy the collection across before starting the
      server. If you are running a Map Maker package on Windows, this is
      already part of the established practice -- see README_FIRST.txt in the
      Map Maker folder.

Select the OS you need to install the package. If you can't find the OS
you want install the server, the source is not ported to this OS.

Enter the folder and read the README.txt inside. For most OS, you have to run
a install script or a batch file.

If you don't have a binary package, you need to compile the server source first.

Source packages have a /make and a /src folder inside the Daimonin/server
folder.

If you have problems to install the package, contact the
Daimonin dev team for more infos:
