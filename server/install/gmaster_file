# GMASTER_FILE (file is changed from server at runtime)
#
# <name>:<password>:<host>:<mode>
#
# <name> is a character name. May be '*' for any name. Must not contain the ':'
# character.
#
# <password> is a login password. May be '*' for any password. Must not
# contain the ':' character.
#
# <host> is an IP address. May be '*' for any host. Must not contain the ':'
# character. THIS DOES NOT WORK AS IPv6 USES ':' IN THE HOST NAME.
#
# <mode> is one of VOL, GM, or DM.
#
# The following (which allows any player to be any type of gmaster) is useful
# on local servers for testing. Just uncomment the next line:
#*:*:*:DM
