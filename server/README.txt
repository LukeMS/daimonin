Daimonin Server

To install a server you must go in the /install folder and run the installation
script for your OS. Read the README.txt in the /install folder for more info.

If you have a source package, you must compile the server first (if you have
a binary package, there are no /make and /src folders in the Daimonin/server
directory).

If you find a daimon_server executable in the same folder this README.txt is,
you can start the server (after you run the install script for your OS).
