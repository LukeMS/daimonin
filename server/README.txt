Daimonin Server

To start your Daimon server, you need 2 things: a daimonin_server executable
and a installed PYTHON script engine.

You can download the python script engine from the python homepage:

http://www.python.org/

On linux system python is often pre-installed - on win32 system you usally need
to install it first. Packages for most OS there come with a nice installer
and/or as binary package. For the source package, read about it in the /make folder.

Version: Be sure your python version is at last 2.2.1. or higher.
Lower version will invoke problems with the scripts.

When you have a installed python engine, you can install or compile the server.

To install a server you must go in the /install folder and run the installation
script for your OS. Read the README.txt in the /install folder for more info.

If you have a source package, you must compile the server first (if you have
a binary package, there are no /make and /src folders in the Daimonin/server
directory).

If you find a daimon_server executable in the same folder this README.txt is,
you can start the server (after you run the install script for your OS).
