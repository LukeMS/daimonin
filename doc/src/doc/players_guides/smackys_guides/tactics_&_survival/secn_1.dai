    <section id="problem"><title>The problem</title>
        <p>Combat is the focus of the game -- it's the primary (and often only) way to gain experience, items, and money, and complete quests.
        </p>
        <p>So you have to kill mobs (if you don't they have no qualms about killing you).
        </p>
        <p>But Daimonin is a massively multiplayer game. At the time of writing this means that there may be 60 or more other players online also trying to kill mobs.
        </p>

    <section id="solution"><title>The solution</title>
        <p>The potential for conflict is obvious. However, many problems can be avoided by observing the few common sense guidelines detailed in this section.

                <p>With many players training in close proximity to one another it is good practice to sort out claims <em>before</em> you begin combat.

                <p>Deliberately killing a mob which someone else was fighting is generally considered extremely rude.

                <p>Many players have items which cast an ice- or firestorm spell. These should be used with care!
