            Introduction
        </title>
        <p>
            A great deal of information, statistics, and functionality is available unofficially through Cherbot, inluding some useful communication features
        </p>
        <p>
            Cherbot is... wait for it... a bot (an artificial player controlled by a piece of software). He resides in a cell in Stoneglow jail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cherbot's two most important functions as regards communication are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="#mail">mail</a>; and
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="#clanchat">clan chat</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
            <p>
                <img alt="[NOTE]" src="../note.png"/> Cherbot has his own very comprehensive web page at <a href="http://www.itcqis.com/daimonin/">http://www.itcqis.com/daimonin/</a> so I won't repeat it in detail here.

            <a href="http://www.itcqis.de/daimonin/commands#mail">Mail</a>
        </title>
        <p>
            Using these commands you can send a private message to a player regardless of whether he is online or offline, and of course manage such messages which have been sent to you.

        <title>
            <a href="http://www.itcqis.de/daimonin/commands#groups">Clan chat</a>
        </title>
        <p>
            Using these commands you can send a message to all players currently online who are members of a particular clan (you must be a member too).
