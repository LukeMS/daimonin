            Penalties

        <p>
            The precise nature of a penalty, and whether it is preceded by a warning, will be determined by the Vols on a case-by-case basis. See the stickies 'Enforcement of the Game Rules' and 'General Interpretation of the Game Rules' for further explanation of these issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            A violation of this rule will not of itself be punished. Rather, offenders will be deemed to have implicitly waived all rights to 'protection' of their <em>character(s)</em> under the Game Rules and will face harsher and longer penalties, without any warning, in future.
