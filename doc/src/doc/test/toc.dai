    <title>Advanced automatic ToC generation demonstration</title>
    <p>
        This is a demonstration of how to automatically generate a ToC of all the sections in a DAI document (only appears in an [X]HTML transformation)..
    </p>
    <p>
        The top-level section should have an autotoc attribute. If <code>autotoc="autotoc"</code> the ToC will be titled "Table of Contents". Otherwise it will be titled according to the value of autotoc (as here).
    </p>
    <p>
        The autotoc attribute will be ignored in any sub-sections.
    </p>
    <section>
        <title>Hierarchy</title>
        <p>
            The ToC is hierarchical. By default each and every section is listed in the ToC.
        </p>
        <section toc="include">
            <title>Explicit inclusion</title>
            <p>
                If you like, give a sub-section a toc attribute with the value "include" to explicitly specify the default behaviour (maybe makes source clearer).
            </p>
            <p>
                The toc attribute will be ignored in the top-level section.
            </p>
            <section toc="exclude">
                <title>Explicit exclusion</title>
                <p>
                    If <code>toc="exclude"</code> the section is not listed in the ToC.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Sub-sections after an explicit exclude</title>
                <p>
                    The Toc hierarchy picks up again at the next included section. But note that it is no longer the same as the section hierarchy.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>DAI doesn't like hierarchies of more than four sections</title>
                <p>
                    So don't do it. If you do the ToC will cope, and the actual section will not be transformed but will be titleless
