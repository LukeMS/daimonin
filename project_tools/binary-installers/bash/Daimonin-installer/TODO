* The qt GUI (uses kdialog) has all sorts of issues. These seem to be cosmetic
  only so installation does work but ain't pretty.

  In particular, no progress dialog is displayed during installation.

* Not much I can do about this one, but the desktop entry file has several
  actions (PlayMain, PlayDev, and Uninstall). However no DEs seem to support
  actions so these are not accessible.

  I COULD create several top-level desktop entry files and possibly a new
  Daimonin category so as not to clutter Games but IMO these are somewhat ugly
  solutions to a problem which is not an application writer's responsibility to
  solve. Perhaps wait for DEs to work properly?

* gui_choosedir: I'd prefer a two-step solution: 1) a text entry dialog with a
  browse button; 2) if browse is clicked, open the file-selection dialog. But
  zenity/kdialog do not seem to work like that (no way to specify buttons
  and/or no browse dialog) so we go straight to the file-selection dialog.

  In theory I can think of a simple update to zenity at least that would
  accomplish this. Obviously this is only useful if added to the official code,
  so perhaps later I will code a patch and submit to the devs.

* General tidying and finish commenting install.bash.

* Check/patch auto-updater under Linux and include in this package.

* Write proper GUI launcher and include in this installer rather than
  daimonin script.
