	* Replace {{gui ...}} special markup with <!-- GUI=... -->.

	* Some work on the desktop entry file. In particular, KDE seems not to
	  handle this as I would expect. This should at least make it
	  functional.
	* Add closing </p> and </pre> tags in .html files and remove them in
	  gui_showtext for qt. I omitted these originally because kdialog
	  (wrongly) prints them as inline text. But without them zenity
	  (rightly) does not know where to end the pre section (</p> are
	  optional anyway.)

	* Ensure installed files have correct permissions.
	* Fix typo in desktop entry.

2014-12-06  Smacky

	* Always be explicit about $INSTALLSUFFIX to prevent uninstall
	  disasters.
	* Improve validation of installation directory.

2014-12-04  Smacky

	* Initial release.
