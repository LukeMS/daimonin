1. ABOUT

This is a script for Blender which renders area 1x1x1.5 tiles in centre of scene into output, that is fit for Daimonin (see http://daimonin.net), with desired rotations and animations.


2. INSTALLATION

Unpack the stuff anywhere :)


3. SETTING UP

3.1 Open Blender from command-line ie console (Using Windows and don't know? Generally its start->launch("cmd") ask Microsoft support).
Its vital that you open Blender from console, so you see eventual errors.

3.2 Open/make your model. Make sure the model is 1 x 1 x 1.5 tiles large!!! Resize it if it is not!

3.3 Change to the desired name mask for the images (line 48). Get to know image (and arch) naming conventions, if you don't already: 
http://www.daimonin.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=3879&start=0

3.4 Check if you like the directory, to which the rendered images are saved (line 52). 
Default is the directory where current_scene.blend is, so you probably dont want to change it.

3.5 Set the desired number of rotations (line 56) and mind that beginning position of camera is under median when looking from top view.

3.6 If you want larger/smaller images change line 61. 
For example you want 2x2 daimonin tiles large monster, so you make him on 1x1x1.5 blender tiles (as usual) and set rsmulti to 2.

3.7 By default, the script uses sun light source (energy=2) which rotates with the camera. 
If you don't want to use it, change usescriptlamp to 0 (line 64)

3.8 Set direction in which your model is facing on line 70.
Default is above median when looking from top view.

3.9 Moving your model to median for rendering could be difficult, so you can set position of your model and camera will move there... set it on lines 73-75.
(Unfortunately this cannot be done with the model size - you have to resize it to fit 1x1x1.5)

3.10 Set you animation settings. This can be done in 2 ways. 
If you don't want any animation - just one frame, you don't have to change anything.
3.10.1 Default way: Just set framestep on line 79.
3.10.2 Override way: Turn override on (line 86), set start and end frames on lines 87, 88 and don't forget to set the framestep (line 79)

3.11 In Blender configure your renderer in way you like.
Also I recommend changing the sky colour to black or toggling on the button "Key" in renderer settings (also try "Prem") - you will notice changes in transparency/colour edges of the images.

3.12 Check again everything :)

3.13 Press alt+p in the Blender editor window

Unfortunately the images you get are not indexed (ie are in RGB) which is currently required by Daimonin, so you have to index them by hand (for example in GIMP).
