These files provide filetype detection and syntax highlighting for anim(ation),
arc(hetype), and art(ifact) files. They're far from perfect, but it's my first
attempt. If you can improve them, please do so.

They should also be fine for Crossfire, but no promises.

To use, copy everything in the directory project_tools/arch/vim to your Vim
user runtime directory (eg, ~/.vim on Linux (you may need to create this
first)).
