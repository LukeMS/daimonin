These files provide filetype detection and syntax highlighting for arch and
anim files. They're far from perfect, but it's my first attempt. If you can
improve them, please do so.

They should also be fine for Crossfire, but no promises.

They might work to some extent for artifact and map files (but of course will
need to be loaded manually, or you can modify the filetype detection). But
they're not intended for that. At some point I'll write dedicated syntax
highlighting files for these filetypes.

To use, copy everything in the directory project_tools/arch/vim to your user
runtime directory (eg, ~/.vim on Linux (you may need to create this first)).
