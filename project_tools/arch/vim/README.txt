These files provide filetype detection and syntax highlighting for anim(ation),
arc(hetype), and art(ifact) files. They're far from perfect, but it's my first
attempt. If you can improve them, please do so.

They should also be fine for Crossfire, but no promises.

They might work to some extent for map files (but of course will need to be
loaded manually, or you can modify the filetype detection). But they're not
intended for that. At some point I'll write dedicated filetype detection and
syntax highlighting files for map files

To use, copy everything in the directory project_tools/arch/vim to your Vim
user runtime directory (eg, ~/.vim on Linux (you may need to create this
first)).
