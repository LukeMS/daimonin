These files provide filetype detection and syntax highlighting for map files.
They're far from perfect, but along with project_files/arch/vim/ it's my first
attempt. If you can improve them, please do so.

They should also be fine for Crossfire, but no promises.

To use, copy everything in the directories project_tools/arch/vim and
project_tools/maps/vim to your Vim user runtime directory (eg, ~/.vim on Linux
(you may need to create this first)).
